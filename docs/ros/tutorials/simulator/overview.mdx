The Clearpath simulator uses [Gazebo Fortress](https://gazebosim.org/home) to simulate robots in a physics-based environment. The simulation
supports the [Clearpath Config](../overview#terminology), as well as simulating multiple robots simultaneously. Gazebo data is bridged to ROS 2, and follows the [Clearpath API](../api/overview).
The Clearpath simulator can be used to iterate on robot configurations, test controls, develop navigation software, and much more.

### Bridging Gazebo to ROS 2

Gazebo uses its own transport layer consisting of nodes and messages similar to ROS 2. A [ROS 2 bridge node](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/tree/humble/ros_gz_bridge) is required to bridge Gazebo data to ROS 2, and vice versa. By leveraging the [generators](../config/generators), we can generate the required bridges when the simulator is launched. As a result, the simulator can support all of the same configurations that a physical robot supports.

For [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) and beyond, the software structure of Clearpath robots has changed significantly. Rather than having individual sets of packages for each
robot, we have opted to create common `clearpath` packages which are used by all supported platforms. Additionally, we are moving away from using environment variables
to customize the robot, and instead using a YAML configuration file to describe the robot. We have also defined a [ROS 2 API](api/overview.mdx) common to all of our supported platforms. As a result,
our platforms are now more customizable, more modular, and more unified.

## Terminology {#terminology}

**_Clearpath Platform_**: The _platform_ refers to the vehicle that makes up the base of the robot. The platform may be referred to by
the platform code to indicate the revision.

**_Clearpath Robot_**: The _robot_ refers to the entire robotic system, including the platform, sensors, and additional accessories.

**_Clearpath Config_**: The _config_ refers to the `robot.yaml` configuration file that defines the Clearpath robot.

**_Clearpath API_**: The _API_ refers to the [ROS 2 application programming interface](api/overview.mdx). This is a set of ROS 2 topics and services defined
by Clearpath which are used by all supported Clearpath platforms.

While some sensor drivers may support other sensor models, the table below represents the
sensors that have been validated by Clearpath.

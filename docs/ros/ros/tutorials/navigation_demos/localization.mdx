Localization is a method of tracking the robots location within an existing map. It is generally done using
laser scan data from a 2D LIDAR, and the robots odometry. For this demo we are using the [Nav2](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2) package launch localization.
This tutorial will use the [Clearpath simulator](../simulator/overview), but will work on a physical robot too. We will be using a J100 with a Hokuyo UST10 attached to the front of the robot. The `robot.yaml` is available here. <---TODO

:::tip
Make sure you have installed the simulator before starting this tutorial. Take a look at the [installation](../simulator/install) guide for details.
:::

## Launching the simulation and localization

**1. Move the `robot.yaml` file to your setup folder (`$HOME/clearpath` by default).**

**2. Launch the simulation**

```
ros2 launch clearpath_gz simulation.launch.py
```

Click on the orange play button in the bottom left corner to start the simulation.

**3. In another terminal, launch RViz**

```
ros2 launch clearpath_viz view_navigation.launch.py namespace:=j100_0001
```
**4. In another terminal, launch localization**

```
ros2 launch clearpath_nav2_demos localization.launch.py setup_path:=$HOME/clearpath/ use_sim_time:=true
```

The default map used by `localization.launch.py` is a [map](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_nav2_demos/blob/main/maps/warehouse.yaml) of the simulated warehouse world.
If you are using a custom map, pass it in with the `map` launch argument:

```
ros2 launch clearpath_nav2_demos localization.launch.py setup_path:=$HOME/clearpath/ use_sim_time:=true map:=/path/to/my/map.yaml
```

**5. Set the initial pose of the robot**

Use the **2D Pose Estimate** tool in RViz to set the initial pose of the robot. You can now drive the robot
and it will calculate its position on the map.

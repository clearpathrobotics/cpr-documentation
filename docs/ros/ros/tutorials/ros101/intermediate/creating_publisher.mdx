We will first be creating a workspace to work from, then we will write a
simple publisher that will make our virtual Husky drive around randomly.

This tutorial is intended for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) and [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic).

## Creating a Workspace and Package

Before we begin writing a node, we need to create a workspace and a
package. Workspaces are simply directories to store all of your
packages. First we will need to create a new directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/ros101
```

This created a directory in your home folder which we will use as a
workspace directory. We now need to create a subdirectory in your
workspace directory to store all your source code for your packages.

```bash
mkdir ~/ros101/src
```

The last step to creating the workspace will be to initialize the
workspace with **catkin_init_workspace**.

```bash
cd ~/ros101/src
catkin_init_workspace
```

Now that our workspace has been created, we will create a package in the
src directory we just created. This can be done by navigating to the
**\~/ros101/src directory**, which you should have already done in the
last step. We can create the package using the **catkin_create_pkg**
command followed by what we want the package to be named, and then
followed by what other packages our package will be dependent on. All
this command really does is creates another directory for your new
package, and two new configuration files inside that directory with some
default settings.

```bash
catkin_create_pkg random_husky_driver roscpp std_msgs
```

You can see that this created **CMakeLists.txt** and **package.xml**
inside the random_husky_driver directory, this is also where you will
store all your source code for your packages. The **roscpp** and
**std_msgs** dependencies were added into the **MakeLIst.txt** and
**package.xml**.

## Writing the Publisher

As mentioned in our previous post, a publisher publishes messages to a
particular topic. For this tutorial, we will be publishing random
commands to the **/husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel** topic to make
your Husky visualization drive itself. Start by creating a file in your
**\~/ros101/src/random_husky_driver** directory called
**random_driver.cpp**. First make sure you're in the
random_husky_driver directory and type the following.

```bash
gedit random_driver.cpp
```

This will create and open the new driver file. Within the new driver
file, copy the following code.

```c
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/Twist.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
//Initializes ROS, and sets up a node
ros::init(argc, argv, "random_husky_commands");
ros::NodeHandle nh;

//Ceates the publisher, and tells it to publish
//to the husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel topic, with a queue size of 100
ros::Publisher pub=nh.advertise<geometry_msgs::Twist>("husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel", 100);

//Sets up the random number generator
srand(time(0));

//Sets the loop to publish at a rate of 10Hz
ros::Rate rate(10);

  while(ros::ok()) {
    //Declares the message to be sent
    geometry_msgs::Twist msg;
    //Random x value between -2 and 2
    msg.linear.x=4*double(rand())/double(RAND_MAX)-2;
    //Random y value between -3 and 3
    msg.angular.z=6*double(rand())/double(RAND_MAX)-3;
    //Publish the message
    pub.publish(msg);

    //Delays until it is time to send another message
    rate.sleep();
    }
}
```

Lets break down this code line by line,

```c
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/Twist.h>
```

These lines includes the headers that we are going to need. The
**<ros/ros.h\>** header is required for ROS functionality and the
**<geometry_msgs/Twist.h\>** is added so that we can create a message
of that type.

```c
ros::init(argc, argv, "random_husky_commands");
ros::NodeHandle nh;
```

The first line, ros:/:init, is used to initialize the ROS node, and name
it "random_husky_commands", while ros:NodeHandle starts the node.

```c
ros::Publisher pub=nh.advertise<geometry_msgs::Twist>("husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel", 100);
```

Publishing a message is done using **ros:Publisher pub=nh.advertise**,
followed by the message type that we are going to be sending, in this
case it is a **geometry_msga::Twist**, and the topic that we are going
to be sending it too, which for us is
**husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel**. The 100 is the message queue
size, that is, if you are publishing message faster then what roscpp can
send, 100 messages will be saved in the queue to be sent. The larger the
queue, the more delay in robot movement in case of buffering. Therefore
in a real life example, you will want to have a smaller queue in the
case of robot movement, where delay in movement commands are undesirable
and even dangerous, but dropped messages are acceptable. In the case of
sensors, it is recommended to use a larger queue, since delay is
acceptable to ensure no data is lost.

```c
ros::Rate rate(10)
...
rate.sleep()
```

ROS is able to control the loop frequency using **ros:Rate** to dictate
how rapidly the loop will run in Hz. rate.sleep will delay a variable
amount of time such that your loop cycles at the desired frequency. This
accounts for time consumed by other parts of the loop. All Clearpath
robots require a minimum loop rate of 10Hz.

```c
while(ros::ok())
```

The ros::ok function will return true unless it receives a command to
shut down, either by using the rosnode kill command, or by the user
pushing Ctrl-C in a terminal.

```c
geometry_msgs::Twist msg;
```

This creates the message we are going to send, msg, of the type
**geometry_msgs:Twist**

```c
msg.linear.x=4*double(rand())/double(RAND_MAX)-2;
msg.angular.z=6*double(rand())/double(RAND_MAX)-3;
```

These lines calculate the random linear x and angular z values that will
be sent to Husky.

```c
pub.publish(msg)
```

We are finally ready to publish the message! The **pub.publish** adds
msg to the publisher queue to be sent.

## Compiling the Random Husky Driver

Compilation in ROS in handled by the catkin build system. The first step
would usually be to set up our package dependencies in the
**CMakeLists.txt** and **package.xml**. However this has already been
done for us when we created the package and specified our dependencies.
The next step is then to declare our new node as a executable, this is
done by adding the following two lines to the **CMakeLists.txt** files
in **\~/ros101/src/random_husky_driver**. You can add them as the last
two lines in the file.

```bash
add_executable(random_driver random_driver.cpp)
target_link_libraries(random_driver ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
```

The first line creates the executable called random_driver, and directs
ROS to it's source files. The second lines specifies what libraries
will be used. Now we need to build our workspace using the
**catkin_make** command in the workspace directory

```bash
cd ~/ros101
catkin_make
```

Let's bring up the husky visualization as we did in a previous blog
post.

```bash
roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_empty_world.launch
```

The final step is to source your setup.bash file in the workspace you
have created. This allows ROS to find the packages that are contained in
your workspace. Dont forget this process will have to be done on every
new terminal instance!

```bash
source ~/ros101/devel/setup.bash
```

It's now time to test it out! With gazebo still running, lets start the
node.

```bash
rosrun random_husky_driver random_driver
```

You should now see Husky drive around! In a new terminal window, we can
make sure that our node is publishing to the
**/husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel** topic by echoing all messages on
this topic

```bash
rostopic echo /husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel
```

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/randomecho.png)

You should now see a stream of random linear x and angular z values.

The ROS 2 API is a standard naming scheme for ROS 2 topics and services. Every supported Clearpath
robot uses this API, making it easy to use the robots interchangeably.


## QoS Profiles {#qos-profiles}

Topics and services in ROS 2 use Quality of Service (QoS) profiles to change communication policies. The QoS profile
of a topic or service has several policies such as history, depth, reliability, durability, and more. For more details on 
QoS settings, visit the [ROS 2 documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html).

For Clearpath platforms, the main policies that may change between different topics and services are reliability and durability. For reliability
there are two options: *Best Effort*, and *Reliable*. A *Best Effort* reliability suggests that an attempt will be made to publish
the data, but if the network is not robust then the data may be lost. On the other hand, *Reliable* guarantees that the data will be received.
This may require that the data be sent multiple times.

The durability of a QoS profile can be either *Transient Local* or *Volatile*. *Transient Local* means that data for published messages will
be stored by the publisher even after it has been published. A new subscriber will receive the data even if a lot of time has passed since it was originally published.
This durability is typically used for data that only needs to be published once, such as the robot description. The other durability policy is *Volatile* which does not
stored old messages. The messages are published and only active subscribers will receive the data. New subscribers will have to wait for the next message to be published.
Most topics will use a *Volatile* durability policy.

It is important to check for [QoS compatibility](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html#qos-compatibilities) when interacting with ROS 2.
Mixing of QoS policies when publishing or subscribing to topics can lead to incompatibility. For example, subscribing to a Best Effort publisher with a Reliable subscriber
is not compatible and will result in no data being received on the subscriber. The easiest way to check the QoS profile of a topic is to use the ROS 2 command line interface (CLI).

```
ros2 topic info /topic_name -v
```

### Common QoS profiles {#common-qos-profiles}

The following are some common QoS profiles used by Clearpath platforms.

#### System Default

* **History**: *Keep Last*
* **Depth**: *10*
* **Reliability**: *Reliable*
* **Durability**: *Volatile*
* **Deadline**: *System Default*
* **Lifespan**: *System Default*
* **Liveliness**: *Automatic*
* **Lease Duration**: *System Default*

The *System Default* QoS profile is the most common profile used by most topics.

#### Sensor Data

* **History**: *Keep Last*
* **Depth**: *5*
* **Reliability**: *Best Effort*
* **Durability**: *Volatile*
* **Deadline**: *System Default*
* **Lifespan**: *System Default*
* **Liveliness**: *Automatic*
* **Lease Duration**: *System Default*

The *Sensor Data* QoS Profile uses a *Best Effort* reliability to send the latest data
as soon as possible, without bothering to resend data that was not received. This is mostly used
by the MCU and sensor drivers.

:::note
Not all sensor drivers use this QoS profile. Always check the QoS profile before trying to subscribe to the topic.

#### Transient Local

* **History**: *Keep Last*
* **Depth**: *10*
* **Reliability**: *Reliable*
* **Durability**: *Transient Local*
* **Deadline**: *System Default*
* **Lifespan**: *System Default*
* **Liveliness**: *Automatic*
* **Lease Duration**: *System Default*

The *Transient Local* QoS Profile offers a *Transient Local* durability, and is typically used by topics that only
want to send messages once. For Clearpath platforms, this includes the robot description topic and the `/rosout` topic
which offers system logs.

## Namespacing

Namespacing is the method of adding a prefix to a robots nodes and topics, to differentiate them from another robot that
may be on the same network. For example, every robot will have a `cmd_vel` topic for commanding velocity. If both robots
used the same topic, then they would both drive when a message is published to that topic. By namespacing, we can remap the topic
to `robot1/cmd_vel` and `robot2/cmd_vel` for each respective robot. 

By default, the namespace of the robot will be obtained from the serial number of the robot. If your serial number is `cpr-a200-0001`, then your namespace
will be `a200_0001`. This can be overwritten in the [robot.yaml](../config/yaml) file.

### Operating System (OS) {#operating-system}

ROS 2 Humble uses [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) as its Tier 1 operating system. Though other operating systems are supported,
it is highly recommended to use Ubuntu 22.04. For the remote PC, Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop should be installed.

### Networking

The remote PC should be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the robot PC, or should be connected via ethernet. If connected over ethernet,
set your static IP to the `192.168.131` subnet, with an IP address that won't interfere with other devices on the network, such as `192.168.131.99`.

### ROS 2 Humble

Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) for installing ROS 2 Humble from debian packages.

### Clearpath Desktop metapackage

Once the ROS 2 Humble has been installed, the [Clearpath Desktop](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_desktop) metapackage can be installed.

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-clearpath-desktop
```

This package will install launch and configuration files for visualising and interacting with the robot.

### Setup Folder

The remote PC will need a copy of the [robot.yaml](../config/yaml) file to generate the same `setup.bash` file as the robot.

1. **Create the folder**

For the remote PC we can create the `clearpath` folder in the home directory:

```
mkdir ~/clearpath/
```
2. **Copy the `robot.yaml` file into the setup folder**

```
cp /path/to/robot.yaml ~/clearpath/
```

:::note
If you have workspaces defined in the `robot.yaml` that do not exist on the remote PC, remove them.
:::

3. **Generate the `setup.bash` file**

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run clearpath_generator_common generate_bash -s ~/clearpath
```

Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file to automatically source the generated `setup.bash` file in new terminals:

```
source /etc/clearpath/setup.bash
```

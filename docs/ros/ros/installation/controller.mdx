Joystick controllers are used for teleoperation; they allow you to remotely drive the Jackal, whether it is a physical Jackal robot,
or a simulated Jackal. The following instructions below detail how to pair different controllers to the Jackal’s computer; however,
these instructions can also be used to pair these controllers to your own computer.

### Logitech F710 Controller

:::note
If your Jackal comes with a Logitech F710 controller, it will be paired already.
Simply turn on the Jackal, plug the USB dongle into one of the Jackal’s USB ports, and turn on the controller.
:::

To re-pair the Logitech F710 controller or pair a new Logitech F710 controller,
plug the controller’s USB dongle into the Jackal’s computer and turn on the controller. The controller automatically pairs.

### PS4 Controller

:::note
If your Jackal comes with a PS4 controller, it will be paired already. Simply turn on the Jackal and turn on the controller.
:::

To re-pair the PS4 controller or pair a new PS4 controller:

1. Install the python-ds4drv package if it is not installed already. In terminal, run:

```
sudo apt-get install python-ds4drv
```
2. Put the controller in pairing mode. Press and hold the PS and Share buttons on your controller until the LED begins rapidly flashing white.
3. Run the `ds4drv-pair` script to pair the controller to the computer. In terminal, run:

```
sudo ds4drv-pair
```
This script will scan for nearby Bluetooth devices, and pair automatically to the controller.

Alternatively, if ds4drv-pair fails to detect the controller, you can pair the controller using `bluetoothctl`:

1. Install the `bluez` package if it is not installed already. In terminal, run:

```
sudo apt-get install bluez
```
2. Run the `bluetoothctl` command. In terminal, run:

```
sudo bluetoothctl
```
3. Use `bluetoothctl` to scan for nearby devices. In the bluetooth control application, run:

```
agent on
scan on
```
4. Put the controller in pairing mode. Press and hold the PS and Share buttons on your controller until the LED begins rapidly flashing white.
5. The bluetooth scan will display the MAC addresses of nearby devices. Determine which MAC address corresponds to the controller and copy it. In the bluetooth control application, run:

```
scan off
pair <MAC Address>
trust <MAC Address>
connect <MAC Address>
```

The controller should now be paired.

:::note
Make sure to set the correct controller type in your [robot.yaml](../config/yaml) file

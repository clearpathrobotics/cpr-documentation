For [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) and beyond, the software structure of Clearpath robots has changed significantly. Rather than having individual sets of packages for each
robot, we have opted to create common `clearpath` packages which are used by all supported platforms. Additionally, we are moving away from using environment variables
to customize the robot, and instead using a YAML configuration file to describe the robot. We have also defined a [ROS 2 API](api/overview) common to all of our supported platforms. As a result,
our platforms are now more customizable, more modular, and more unified.


## Terminology {#terminology}

***Clearpath Platform***: The *platform* refers to the vehicle that makes up the base of the robot. The platform may be referred to by
the platform code to indicate the revision.

***Clearpath Robot***: The *robot* refers to the entire robotic system, including the platform, sensors, and additional accessories.

***Clearpath Config***: The *config* refers to the `robot.yaml` configuration file that defines the Clearpath robot.

***Clearpath API***: The *API* refers to the [ROS 2 application programming interface](api/overview). This is a set of ROS 2 topics and services defined
by Clearpath which are used by all supported Clearpath platforms.

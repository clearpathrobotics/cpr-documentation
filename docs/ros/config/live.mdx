Users familiar with Clearpath robots, know we provide desktop packages that facilitate the viewing of robot models in RViz without needing to have a real robot. In ROS 2, the `view_model.launch.py` node will check and update the model and display the new changes in RViz.

This functionality requires a desktop manager to be installed, i.e. these commands will not work on Clearpath robot computers since these run Ubuntu 22.04 server rather than desktop.

# Installation
Install the desktop packages using `apt`. Make sure to have [added Clearpath packages](https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/) to the source list before installation.
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-clearpath-desktop
```

# Setup
Before running the node, we will need to setup the working directory.
First, create the directory `/etc/clearpath`.
Then, copy your `robot.yaml` to `/etc/clearpath/robot.yaml`.

# Run the Node
Running `view_model.launch.py` will generate the URDF of the robot from the `/etc/clearpath/robot.yaml` and then start RViz.

It will then monitor the `/etc/clearpath/robot.yaml` for changes. Whenever changes are detected, the URDF will be regenerated and the RViz model will be updated.

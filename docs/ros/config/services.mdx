To run all ROS 2 nodes in the background and from boot, we use [robot_upstart](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/tree/foxy-devel) to install
the launch files as [systemd](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man5/systemd.service.5.html) services. In ROS 1 there was a single `ros` service that
ran everything. For ROS 2 Humble, we have split this into three separate services:
[Platform](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/blob/main/clearpath_robot/services/clearpath-platform.service),
[Sensors](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/blob/main/clearpath_robot/services/clearpath-sensors.service), and
[Robot](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/blob/main/clearpath_robot/services/clearpath-robot.service).


### Clearpath Platform

The `clearpath-platform` service launches the `clearpath-platform.launch.py` file found under `/etc/clearpath/platform/launch/`. This will launch the nodes
required to operate the base platform, such as control, teleop, localization, and more. Running this service alone is enough to drive the robot, visualise it
in Rviz, and get platform data. This service can be stopped or started without interrupting the sensor service.

### Clearpath Sensors

The `clearpath-sensors` service launches the `clearpath-sensors.launch.py` file found under `/etc/clearpath/sensors/launch/`. This will launch any
sensors defined in the robot YAML. This service can be stopped or started without interrupting the platform service.

### Clearpath Robot

The `clearpath-robot` service is the "parent" service of `clearpath-platform` and `clearpath-sensors`. If it is restarted, then both the platform and sensors services
will restart. This service will run all of the [generators](generators) in the `PreExec` step, before allowing the two dependent services to start. While
the platform and sensors services are running, the robot service will periodically check for changes in the `robot.yaml` file. If a change is detected
the service restarts, re-generating all files and restarting the platform and sensors services.

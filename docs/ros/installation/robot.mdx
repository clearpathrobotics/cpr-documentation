### Operating System (OS) {#operating-system}

ROS 2 Humble uses [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) as its Tier 1 operating system. Though other operating systems are supported,
it is highly recommended to use Ubuntu 22.04. For the robot computer, Ubuntu 22.04 Server should be installed. The server version of the OS will not install a
graphical user interface (GUI).

### First login

Connect the robot's computer to a monitor using an HDMI or DisplayPort cable. Then, connect a USB keyboard. Power the robot on and wait for the Ubuntu login prompt to show up. On a fresh install, the default username and password are both `ubuntu`. You will be prompted to change your password.

Once logged in, create the `administrator` user:

```
sudo adduser --ingroup administrator administrator
```

Follow the prompts, then add `administrator` to the `sudo` group:

```
sudo usermod -aG sudo administrator
```

### Internet Connection

#### Wi-Fi

To configure Wi-Fi, first log in to the robot's computer. This can be done by connecting the computer to a monitor using an HDMI or DisplayPort cable, and connecting a USB keyboard. Power the robot on and wait for the Ubuntu login prompt to show up. On a fresh install, the default username and password are both `ubuntu`. You will be prompted to change your password.

Once logged in, find the name of your Wi-Fi interface by calling `ip a`. Wi-Fi interface names begin with `wl`.

    <img
      src={require("./img/wifi_interface.jpg").default}

    />
  </figure>
</center>

Next, create the file `/etc/netplan/60-wireless.yaml`, and paste the following contents:

```
network:
  wifis:
    # Replace WIRELESS_INTERFACE with the name of the wireless network device, e.g. wlan0 or wlp3s0
    # Fill in the SSID and PASSWORD fields as appropriate.  The password may be included as plain-text
    # or as a password hash.  To generate the hashed password, run
    #   echo -n 'WIFI_PASSWORD' | iconv -t UTF-16LE | openssl md4 -binary | xxd -p
    # If you have multiple wireless cards you may include a block for each device.
    # For more options, see https://netplan.io/reference/
    WIRELESS_INTERFACE:
      optional: true
      access-points:
        SSID_GOES_HERE:
          password: PASSWORD_GOES_HERE
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp4-overrides:
        send-hostname: true
```

Replace `WIRELESS_INTERFACE` with the name of your Wi-Fi interface, `SSID_GOES_HERE` with your Wi-Fi SSID, and `PASSWORD_GOES_HERE` with your Wi-Fi password.

Save the file and call `sudo netplan apply` to apply the changes. Check `ip a` again to make sure that an IP address has been assigned to your Wi-Fi interface.

#### Ethernet

The robot's computer can also be connected to a dhcp network over ethernet. Connect an ethernet cable to the built-in ethernet port on the robot's computer and check that an IP has been assigned with `ip a`.

:::note

You should now be able to SSH into the robot by calling `ssh administrator@<robot_ip>` from a remote computer.

### ROS 2 Humble

Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) for installing ROS 2 Humble from debian packages.

### Clearpath Package Server

The Clearpath package server needs to be added to the robot computer to access robot packages.

Configure Ubuntu's APT package manager to add the package server:

**1. Install the authentication key for the packages.clearpathrobotics.com repository**

```
wget https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```

**2. Add the debian sources for the repository**

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clearpath-latest.list'
```

**3. Update your computerâ€™s package cache**

```
sudo apt-get update
```

### Network Configuration

Once the Clearpath package server is set up, follow the [Clearpath Computer Setup](../networking/computer_setup) instructions to configure the network interfaces.

### Clearpath Robot metapackage

Once the Clearpath package server has been added, the [Clearpath Robot](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot) metapackage can be installed.

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-clearpath-robot
```

Installing this package will also install all dependencies required to run any Clearpath robot and supported sensors, other than Clearpath firmware packages.

#### Source install

**1. Create a workspace on the robot's computer**

```
mkdir ~/clearpath_ws/src -p
```

**2. Import dependencies**

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
sudo apt install python3-vcstool
cd ~/clearpath_ws
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/main/dependencies.repos
vcs import src < dependencies.repos
rosdep install -r --from-paths src -i -y
```

**3. Build packages**

```
colcon build --symlink-install
```

:::note
Make sure to add the workspace to your `robot.yaml` file. TODO: Add link to robot yaml documentation
:::

### Firmware Update

All platforms with the exception of the A200 will require a firmware update to run ROS 2 Humble.

#### J100

Jackal firmware can be flashed from the Jackal's computer.

**1. Download the Jackal Firmware package from the Clearpath package server**

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-jackal-firmware
```

**2. Place the Jackal MCU into bootloader mode**

Switch the _PWR_MODE_ switch from _NORM_ to _ALT_. If the robot is on, press the _M_RST_ button. Otherwise, turn the
robot on with the power button.

**3. Flash the firmware**

```
jackal_firmware_flash.sh
```

Flashing progress will be indicated by the flash script. Wait for the firmware to finish flashing.

:::caution
Do not turn the robot off or unplug the micro-USB cable while flashing firmware. If an error occurs while
flashing, you can attempt to run `jackal_firmware_flash.sh` again.
:::

**4. Place the Jackal MCU into normal mode**

Once the firmware has been flashed, place the Jackal MCU back into normal mode by switching the PWR_MODE switch from ALT to NORM.
The robot will power off. Turn the robot back on by pressing the power button.

### Setup folder

Create the setup folder where the [robot.yaml](../config/yaml) file will be stored, and where files will be generated:

```
sudo mkdir /etc/clearpath/ -p && sudo chmod 666 /etc/clearpath/
```

Copy your `robot.yaml` file into `/etc/clearpath/`.

### Robot services

Clearpath robot services can now be installed with the following command:

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run clearpath_robot install
```

This script uses [robot_upstart](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/tree/foxy-devel) to install the `systemd` services
that will launch platform and sensor launch files as background processes.

To start the services, call

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start clearpath-robot.service
```

Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file to automatically source the generated `setup.bash` file in new terminals:

```
source /etc/clearpath/setup.bash
```

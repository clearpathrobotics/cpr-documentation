## Battery Replacement

If Ridgeback's batteries need replacement, they are accessible by removing the top-plate and the insulator
cover. Before performing any service or maintenance to the robot, the battery pack must be fully disconnected.
The batteries weigh approximately 33 kg (73 lbs) each, so use all necessary care and caution when lifting the
batteries out of the chassis. Please contact Clearpath Robotics regarding replacement batteries.

## Long-term storage

When storing Ridgeback for long periods of time, its important to properly maintain the batteries to fully
maximize their life. Consider one of the following two procedures when placing Ridgeback in long-term storage:

- Fully charge Ridgeback, turn it off and put it into storage. Once a week, connect power to the charger
  and allow the charger to top up the battery for an hour or so.
- Fully charge Ridgeback, turn it off and put it into storage, but leave the charger connected and powered
  the enitre time Ridgeback is in storage. The charger will monitor the battery and will automatically
  charge it up as needed.

Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Ridgeback's batteries.

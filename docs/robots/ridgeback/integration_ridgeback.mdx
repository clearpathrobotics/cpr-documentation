<ComponentIntroductionRidgeback />

To attach custom hardware to Ridgeback, you will have to take care of mechanical mounting, electrical
supply, and software integration. This guide aims to equip you with respect to these challenges.

---

### Mechanical Mounting

When determining mechanical mounting, you can use the Standard mounting pattern on the Ridgeback.
At this time, the "PACS" mounting system is not available for Ridgeback.

#### Mechanical, Standard {#ridgeback-payload-mechanical-integration}

The payload integration plate can be used to mount external payloads on top of the Ridgeback. The plate
is made of aluminum, which allows Ridgeback to support payloads up to 100 kg (220 lbs). Ridgeback's
batteries are positioned low in the chassis and slightly rearward of center of the robot to balance the
weight distribution when mounting front-facing manipulator payloads. To minimize the possibility of tipping
over, payload structures should always be mounted as close to center as possible.

##### Payload Mounting Holes

Located at the front-end of the mounting plate are two 5/8"-11 screw holes for mounting Baxter, UR5/UR510 manipulator
arms, or any other payload structure. These holes are indicated in the figure below. If you purchased the Baxter
or UR5/UR10 package from Clearpath Robotics, Ridgeback will come with the required hardware adapters to securely mount
the payload structures to the plate.

If your payload structure requires additional mounting holes or a different hole configuration, the plate can be removed
and additional holes can be drilled. To remove the mounting plate, simply remove the screws that form the diamond pattern
on top of the plate.

:::warning

Permanent damage resulting from custom modifications to the mounting plate is not covered under warranty and may not be
supported by Clearpath Support. Please contact our support team if you require assistance or have any questions relating
to custom modifications.

:::

### Electrical Integration {#ridgeback-payload-electrical-integration}

Except for bus-powered USB cameras, most payloads have separate leads for power and data.

#### Data Connections

The two larger holes on the left and right side of the payload integration plate allow you to pass
electrical wires and cables from the mounted payloads into the User Bay. Electrical wires should always
pass through the provided plastic grommets to protect against cutting and abrasion.

Ridgeback's internal computer options support USB3 and Ethernet connectivity.

An Ethernet switch or PoE power injector can be added to the User Bay as required.

#### Connector Summary {#ridgeback-connector-summary}

Several user power connectors are accessible in the User Bay for powering user payloads.
These are summarized in the following table and described in more detail in the following sections.
The power rails on the User Bay Power board are protected against short circuit by fuses. See the
illustration for the connector and fuse locations.

- For the High Current VBAT User Power (labelled as 24 VDC, 20 A MAX), terminate your payload's power lead with the appropriate Anderson connectors.
- For the User Power Ports, terminate your payload's power lead with the appropriate crimps and pins.
  for the four pin Molex connector. The maximum current draw permitted on each rail is 5A.
- For the Inverter Power, terminate your payload's power lead with the appropriate Anderson connectors.

#### User Power Connections

Similar to the data connections, power leads may be brought through the two larger holes on the left and
right side of the payload integration plate, and connected to the power ports in the User Bay.
The following are available as user power:

- Unregulated VBAT power (25.6 V nominal) available in two ways:
  - High Current VBAT User Power (20 A max)
  - User Power ports: 5 A, shared across the User Power ports
- Regulated 12 V power: 5 A, shared across the User Power ports
- Regulated 5 V power: 5 A, shared across the User Power ports.

:::caution

Each User Power Port (Molex 0039301040) has a shared ground (GND) pin with a maximum current rating of 8 A. Ensure
that the combined current draw for the VBAT, 12 V, and 5 V pins for the corresponding GND
pin does not exceed 8 A.

:::

:::caution Unregulated Power Rail

The unregulated battery output may range from as low as 20 VDC up to 30 VDC depending on the state of charge of
the battery and the electrical loading on the system. Ensure any accessories connected to that rail are able to
deal with unregulated battery voltages.

:::

:::warning Risk of Fire

For continued protection against risk of fire, always replace fuses only with those of the same type and rating.

:::

#### Optional External Motion Stop {#ridgeback-external-motion-stop}

In addition to the built-in Motion Stop button, an external motion-stop latching button/switch can be added that has similar functionality.
Electrically, the external motion-stop latching button/switch can be connected to the 4-pin MCU connector labelled `E-STOP BREAKOUT` using
a mating connector. This 4-pin connector is the same as the one used for the User Power Ports. Refer to
[Connector Summary](#ridgeback-connector-summary) for details.

The four pins should be connected as follows:

- 1-2: to external motion-stop breakout
  - To engage motion-stop: press and release the latching button/switch (3.3 V)
  - To clear motion-stop: ensure the button is released on the external motion stop, then press and release the Motion Stop button on the
    Ridgeback unit to clear the motion-stop
- 3-4: short these pins to indicate that external motion-stop is present

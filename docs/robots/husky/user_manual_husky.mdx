#### Status Panel

The status panel is a display of LED indicators located on the rear of the chassis which provide information about the current status of Husky.
The indicators are described in the table below.

#### Buttons and Lockouts

The silver button at the top of the Status Panel is used to power the Husky on and off. From the "off" state, pressing the button
will cause the Husky to power on and a blue ring at the edge of the button will be illuminated. From the "on" state, pressing
the button will cause the Husky to power off and the blue ring will no longer be illuminated.

See [Stop Button and Lockout](#husky-stop-button-and-lockout) for details of the stop button and lockout.

#### Payloads

Additional payloads such IMUs, lidars, cameras, GPS, manipulators and many more can be integrated with Husky, either
as part of your Husky purchase or installed after receiving your Husky. You can find a list of supported packages and
related documentation for payloads in this documention portal, under the [Computers](/docs/computers),
[Sensors](/docs/sensors), [Manipulators](/docs/manipulators), and [Accessories](/docs/accessories)
sections. In addition, refer to [Husky Integration](/docs/robots/husky/integration_husky) for details on
how to integrate your own payload or how to integrate a payload kit from Clearpath Robotics. Each payload kit that
ships from Clearpath Robotics comes with a custom mounting bracket and cabling for easy attachment to Husky.

#### Orientation references

The reference frame used by all Clearpath Robotics ground robots is based on ISO 8855, and is shown in the figure below.
Husky's front is shown.
When commanded with a positive translational velocity (forward), wheels travel in the positive x-direction.
The direction of the axes differs from those used for roll, pitch, and yaw in aircraft, and care should be taken to ensure that data is interpreted correctly.

#### Robot Equations

As a starting point, Clearpath Robotics recommends using the following relationship between wheel velocity and platform velocity:

$$
v=\cfrac{v_{r}+v_{l}}{2}
$$

$$
\omega=\cfrac{v_{r}-v_{l}}{w}
$$

$v$ represents the instantaneous translational speed of the platform and $\omega$ the instantaneous rotational speed. <br />
$v_{r}$ and $v_{l}$ are the right and left wheel velocities, respectively. <br />
$w$ is the effective track of the robot, 0.555 m.

## Getting Started

You are ready to go! This section details how to get Husky into action.
To begin, place Husky "up on blocks" as described in the [Safety](#husky-safety) section,
making sure that the wheels are clear of the ground.

For most Husky setups, there will be an Onboard PC which is directly connected to the Husky
and a Remote PC which is used to control Husky and gather data. These two PCs must be set up
to communicate with each other.

### Onboard PC setup

If you purchased an Onboard PC from Clearpath Robotics with Husky, it is already installed,
connected, and powered. If not, or to set up your own Onboard PC, see the
[Husky Tutorials](/docs/robots/husky/tutorials_husky).

Note that the Onboard PC must be connected to Husky's serial port, which is located in the
user power panel accessible from the User Bay.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/robot_husky_11.png"
      width="600"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky's serial port</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The connector is a female DE-9, suitable for connection directly to a USB-serial adaptor or to a PC
serial port via a straight-through modem cable (not a null modem cable). How you connect the Onboard
PC to Husky depends on whether the Onboard PC has a dedicated serial port. Husky is delivered with a
USB-serial adaptor.

### Powering Up

Husky comes with the battery fully charged and installed, but disconnected for safety during shipping.
To reconnect the battery:

- Ensure Husky's main power button is in the "off" position and that stop mode is activated.
- Using curled index fingers to grip the battery door latches, press with thumbs on the latch buttons
  and lift the battery door free of the chassis.
- Carefully connect the battery plug to the mating connector in the fuse panel.
  Ensure that it is firmly seated and clicks into place.
  It will be difficult to connect it in the incorrect polarity.
- Replace the battery door cover, ensuring that it clicks into place and is flush with the rear panel.

<center>
  <img
    src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/robot_husky_13.png"
    width="600"
  />
</center>

To power on Husky, firmly press the power button located above the status panel.
It will illuminate blue, and the status panel lights will show a brief test pattern.
The `COMM` status light will turn red, as the PC is not yet communicating with Husky.

The `STOP` status light will be red if the stop button is pressed.
If the stop button is not pressed, press it and verify that the `STOP` light illuminates.
Leave the platform in stop mode until it is successfully receiving commands, indicated
by the `COMM` Status light turning green or yellow. If a computer was purchased with Husky, it
will be setup to interface automatically upon startup; 60-90 seconds after booting up,
`COMM` Status light will change from red to green (or yellow, depending on the stop
mode status). This indicates that ROS is up on the computer and has established
communications with the Husky base.

### Network Configuration

#### Husky Wired Network Setup

To get Husky connected to your local wifi network, you must first access the Onboard PC using a wired connection
and then connect to one of the network ports with a standard ethernet cable.

<ComponentWiredRobotConnection />

#### Husky Wifi Network Setup

<ComponentWifiRobotConnection />

#### Remote ROS Connectivity

<ComponentRemoteRosConnectivity />

### Connecting and Using the Controller

To use your controller, it must be paired with your Husky and powered on. If your purchased the Onboard PC from
Clearpath Robotics, your controller is already paired with your Husky. If your controller has become
unpaired or if you wish to pair a new controller, following the instructions in the
[Husky Tutorials](/docs/robots/husky/tutorials_husky).

To teleoperate Husky, first release the motion stop. Then, referring to the following images, press the enable
button (either slow or fast mode) and use the left thumbstick to drive Husky.

### Using ROS

<ComponentUsingRos />

### Battery Charging

The battery shipped with Husky A200 may be charged outside the robot or while still inside of Husky.
If charging while installed, you will need to open the access door to the battery area, and
disconnect the battery from its connector in the fuse panel. From there:

1.  Connect the DC output cable from the charger to the battery terminal connector.
2.  Plug the charger power cord into the charger and then into a wall receptacle.
3.  The POWER LED and CHARGING LED lights on the charger will illuminate.
4.  When battery is fully charged, the CHARGING LED light will turn off.
5.  Unplug the charger from the wall and then disconnect it from the battery.

The battery charger shipped with Clearpath Robotics's lead-acid battery-powered products uses a three-state
charge cycle.

1.  A fast, high current initial charge, until the battery voltage reaches 29.6V.
2.  A topping charge, during which the battery charges at 29.6V constant voltage until the current decreases to 500 mA.
3.  A precision float charge, during which the battery voltage is held at 27.6V.
    This mode allows the charger to remain connected to the battery during periods of non-use, keeping it in a state of full charge.
    When in this mode, the CHARGING LED will be off.

## Safety Considerations       {#husky-safety}

Clearpath Robotics is committed to high standards of safety.
Husky contains several features to protect the safety of users and the integrity of the robot.

### General warnings

Husky is a rugged and high-performance robot.
For the safety of yourself and others, always conduct initial experiments and software development with
the robot raised off the ground. Place a wooden crate, a set of sawhorses, a sturdy storage tub, or any
other solid flat structure having a height greater than 150 mm under Husky to keep the wheels clear of the
ground ("up on blocks").

When starting out, favour slower wheel speeds. Husky's control loops can accurately maintain velocities as
low as 0.1 m/s. Operating at such speeds will give you more time to react if things don't go quite as you
expect.

When Husky is operating, keep clear of the wheels, paying particular attention to the pinch hazard which
exists between each wheel and the end of the corresponding bumper bar.

### Stop Button and Lockout     {#husky-stop-button-and-lockout}

:::warning

Ensure the stop button is accessible at all times.
Avoid mounting payloads that extend over the rear of Husky and would occlude the stop button.

:::

The motion-stop function that allows a person in the physical vicinity of the robot
to halt its motion and prevent re-initiation of motion. Power supply to Husky's motor drivers is
enabled by a normally-open relay, which is closed in series with the stop switch. This motion-stop
system is intended for use in emergency situations. The motion stop system should not be used as
the means of controlling robot motion during regular operation.

When in stop mode, the status panel stop light will illuminate red and Husky will not drive.
The commands received during stop mode are not buffered; Husky will always act on the latest commands received.
This means that if the commands are stopped before the stop is released, the Husky will not move.
If the commands are continued, Husky will move at the speed commanded once the stop is released.

This "stop" function can be asserted by pressing the red stop actuator present at the rear of the
Husky, opposite the status panel, as shown in the following figure. The motion-stop function can be
reset by twisting the depressed actuator until it returns to an extended position. There is no second
"start" action required to reset the stop function. The robot may begin moving again immediately
after the stop actuator has returned to its extended position.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/robot_husky_10.png"
      width="600"
    />
    <figcaption>Stop button and lockout</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The lockout provides a way to secure Husky from performing any type of motion.
When in lockout mode, the robot will still power on, but the motors will not drive.

### Electrical System

Husky is powered by a single 24V sealed lead-acid battery, similar to the type found in electric wheelchairs,
golf carts, and other devices. Husky's battery is capable of delivering 1800W, similar to wall mains.
This gives Husky's motors their great performance, however, it is also enough power to cause severe bodily harm.
Please observe the following precautions:

- Do not tamper with the plug attached to the battery.
- Do not tamper with the fuse panel, except to check and change the fuses, and to connect and disconnect the
  battery plug.
- Do not operate Husky without the battery door in place. The battery is not restrained without the door, and
  will come loose, damaging the fuse panel.
- Charge the battery only with the charger provided by Clearpath Robotics.
- Please dispose of the batteries properly.

### Lifting and Transport

For the safety of users and to maximize the lifetime of Husky, please observe the following when manually
transporting the robot:

- Husky should be lifted by two persons, firmly gripping the front and rear bumper-bars.
  The battery can be removed to lighten the load of a manual transport.
- Ensure that Husky is in stop mode when transporting short distances and powered off when transporting
  longer distances.
- Note: It is not advised to push Husky, as this can cause damage to the motors.

### Performance Considerations

Included in Husky are native software checks and limits to protect the robot.
However, it is recommended to monitor the system's status during usage with the `/status` and `/diagnostics` topics.
These topics provides useful information regarding voltages, currents, temperatures and general health of the system.

The total current draw does not include the motors drivers; it is the current consumed by the MCU and user power
ports. Husky's motors are rated to draw 8A continuous, but they will spike to several times this, particularly when
traversing rough terrain and when turning on the spot. To reduce current draw, consider commanding wider-radius turns
from your control software.

The temperature is measured in the motor drivers and on the motor casings; the coils inside the motor casings cannot
be measured. Therefore, it is important to note that the temperature measured on the motor casings is a lagging
indicator of the temperature of the coils inside the casing. Be aware of the delay in heat propagation on the motors
during heavy use. The thermal limit of the system is 50°C, and the system will shut down if this limit is reached.
Monitoring these fields over longer periods of operation will allow you to ensure that you are not putting
excessive wear on Husky's motors.

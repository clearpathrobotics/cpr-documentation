## Status lights

### COMM light on the rear panel is red

A red COMM light means the Husky's computer to microcontroller serial connection is not established.
This serial connection requires:

- The computer to be on
- The USB-Serial cable to be functioning properly. A functioning cable will appear in Ubuntu as `/dev/ttyUSB` or `/dev/ttyACM`
- The serial port has been given permissions in Linux.
- The MCU's microcontroller is on.
- The MCU has Husky's firmware installed on it.
- Functioning connections from the USB-Serial cable to the MCU's microcontroller. (soldered connectors, PCBA traces, microcontroller's soldered pins)

If your robot was functioning recently, the most common causes are:

- The robot's computer is not powered, or is still booting.
  Wait 60 seconds after startup to see if the computer-to-MCU connection starts after the computer turns on.
  If not, connect to the computer wih SSH, or using a computer monitor to see if the computer is running.
- The USB-Serial cable is not connected.
  Check that the USB end is seated in the robot's computer.
  Check that the DE-9 end is seated on it's [jack in the Husky user bay](/docs/robots/husky/user_manual_husky/#husky_user_manual_pinout).
- Someone has changed ROS environment variables. You can review Husky's environment variables by running:
  ```
  nano /etc/ros/setup.bash
  ```

### COMM light is yellow

A yellow COMM light indicates that there is a funcitioning Serial connection between the robot's computer and MCU's microcontroller, but there is a ROS software error on the computer.
The common causes for this error are:

- The Husky's motion-stop button has been pressed. Twist the red button on the back of the Husky clockwise to release the motion-stop.
  You can confirm the motion-stop state in ROS by running:
  ```
  rostopic echo /status
  ```
- The Husky's lockout keyswitch is in the _Locked_ position.
  Use the included key to turn the lockout to the _Unlocked_ position.

### COMM light flickers

This frequently happens when the MCU is not receiving motion commands fast enough.
Increase your published motion command in ROS to at least 10 Hz.

```
rostopic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel ...
```

:::note

The maximum command frequency that Husky accepts is 50 Hz.

:::

### ERR light is on

This light indicates a General Error.
It is red when the Husky is in a motion-stop state, has insufficient battery voltage, or an if there is unspecified software error.

### Stop light is on

The common causes for this error are:

- The Husky's motion-stop button has been pressed. Twist the red button on the back of the Husky clockwise to release the motion-stop.
  You can confirm the motion-stop state in ROS by running:
  ```
  rostopic echo /status
  ```
- The Husky's lockout keyswitch is in the _Locked_ position.
  Use the included key to turn the lockout to the _Unlocked_ position.

### Power button's light is not on

The power button on the back of Husky has a blue light that turns on when the button is pressed, indicating that the Husky is receiving power.
This light will turn on if the switch is receiving power, there is no sofware controlling it.
For the button to turn on:

1.  The Husky needs to have a charged battery installed.
2.  The main fuse on the Husky's MCU needs to be functioning.
3.  The ribbon cable between the MCU and switch PCBA needs to be fully seated on both ends.
4.  The connector on the switch's cable needs to be fully seated on the switch's PCBA.

We have not seen these connections fail, even in applications with lots of vibration.
The most common fix for this issue is to check that battery is charged, and that it's power cable is seated in the Husky's MCU.

### Battery indicator is flashing

Battery voltage is too low for Husky to drive the motors.
Charge the battery and try again.

### Battery indicator only shows 50% charge with a fresh battery

The battery indicator is controlled by the Husky MCU's microcontroller, based on a voltage measurement of the battery.
The controls program was designed for a lithium ion battery.
_24 V lithium ion batteries_ reach a peak voltage of 29 V.
Our Standard _24 V lead acid battery_ does not reach as high of a voltage, so the MCU's microcontroller thinks the battery is not fully charged.

There is not a way to change this behaviour on your Husky.

## Mobility

### Husky experiences momentary drops in communication

1.  It's possible the robot has reached the thermal limit, or current limit.
2.  The maximum current limits are set to 18.3 A, however, as the motors are only rated for 8A continuous, anything above that will trigger the current limit eventually, the higher above this limit, the more quickly it will trigger.
    If you are unsure whether this is the case, feel free to contact support@clearpathrobotics.com with a rosbag of your system.
    Clearpath robotics also offers a high torque upgrade if more torque is required for your project.

### Husky's velocity is inconsistent, with a jumping motion

It's possible the robot has reached the thermal limit, or current limit.
The maximum current limits are set to 18.3 A, however, as the motors are only rated for 8 A continuous, anything above that will trigger the current limit.
The limit will be triggered if your application sends more than 8 A of current to the motors continuously.

:::note

Clearpath Robotics also offers a high torque motor upgrade if more torque is required for your project.

:::

### Husky rolls on a slope

Husky's wheels are always connected to the motors.
When you send a motion command with `/cmd-vel`, the Husky's MCU subscribes to that message, and relays a CAN command to the Husky's motor controllers.
These motor controllers change the voltage across the DC brushed motors, causing a mechamical torque at the wheel.

When you stop publishing to `/cmd_vel`, ROS starts publishing a default value to `/cmd_vel` or zero velocity.
The motor controllers will attempt to achieve zero velocity by monitoring the motor encoders, and increasing voltage to the motor till the encoder stops moving.

:::note

The `/twist_mux` topic controls to priority of `/cmd_vel` messages.

:::

Your Husky will roll if:

- The Husky's motion-stop button is pressed.
  Motion-stops disconnect the motor-controllers.
- The MCU is not functioning.
  This will appear as other issues, such as the status lights not illuminating.
- The computer is not communicating with the MCU.
  This will appear as a red COMM light on the rear panel.
- A motor shaft is broken.

## Networking

### Not getting Wi-Fi internet connection

Reter to the [Troubleshooting section of the Networking page](/docs/software/networking).

### Cannot connect to the robot's computer over a network cable

Reter to the [Troubleshooting section of the Networking page](/docs/software/networking).

---

## Computer

### The computer does not automatically start

Refer to the [Mini ITX troubleshooting page](/docs/computers/mini_itx).

### The computer keeps reverting to old BIOS settings

Refer to the [Mini ITX troubleshooting page](/docs/computers/mini_itx).

---

## ROS

### ROS package is not starting

Verify the upstart logs, `/var/log/upstart/husky_core.log`, to see if there are any error during upstart.

### Sensors are not turning on

1.  Check that the sensor's User Power connector has the correct voltage.
2.  If the voltage is correct, then review the [Troubleshooting section for the related sensor](/docs/sensors).

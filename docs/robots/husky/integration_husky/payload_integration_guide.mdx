# Payload Integration Guide

### User Bay Power Connections

The user area power terminals are capable of supplying VBAT (approximately 24-29 V, unregulated) fused at 5 A, 12 V fused at 7.5 A,
and 24 V fused at 3 A.
282 W of power is available from these User Power breakouts.
You can order a upgrade for your Husky, that will add 480 W of power (VBAT fused at 20 A). Each terminal comes equipped with a
removable connector into which your payload power leads may connect.

Husky UGVs with serial numbers lower than A200-0802 have different user power connections.  
These older robots have 5V, 12V, and 24V supplies, all fused at 5A.
Your Husky's serial number is shown on a sticker, attached to the right side of the robot.

1.  Expose about 5 mm of bare wire from the payload power leads and twist the exposed wire on both leads.
2.  Take 2 molex terminals from the spare parts kit provided and insert the exposed wire and crimp the terminals, ensuring the wires are well secured inside the terminal, as shown below.
3.  Take 1 connector housing from the spare parts kit provided and insert the positive payload power lead (red) into position 4, 5, or 6 of the connector until it locks into place. The positions numbers are visible on the back of the plastic housing.
4.  Insert the negative payload power lead (black) into position 1, 2, or 3 of the connector until it locks into place.

When connecting payloads, be sure to observe correct polarity as marked on the inside of the user bay.
Do not exceed the specified maximum current limit of each power rail; failure to do so may result in damage to Husky or your payload.

For more technical information on the power connectors, as well as their corresponding mating connectors, please visit the [Product Page](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/molex/0039012065/930272?s=N4IgTCBcDaIOoFkwGYDsAGMBaAcgERAF0BfIA).

<!-- TODO: is this out of date? -->
The connectors used in the Husky's user bay are Weidm√ºller's 6 Position Terminal Blocks, to connect your own bare wires, you may use Digi-key part number 281-1856-ND.

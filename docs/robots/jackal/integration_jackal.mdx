## Integration Guide

To attach custom hardware to Jackal, you will have to take care of mechanical mounting, electrical
supply, and software integration. This section aims to equip you with respect to these challenges.

### Mechanical Mounting

When determining mechanical mounting, you can use the Standard square mounting pattern on the lid of the Jackal.
At this time, the "PACS" mounting system is not available for Jackal.

#### Mechanical, Standard

A standard Jackal is delivered with an 80 mm square mounting pattern of M5 threaded holes on its lid, which can be
used for attaching external payloads. The mounting holes come with M5 screws pre-installed.
You may mount your hardware directly onto the lid or you may design and mount a new plate to the lid and secure
it to the lid using M5 screws.

### Electrical Integration {#jackal-payload-electrical-integration}

Except for bus-powered USB cameras, most payloads have separate leads for power and data.

#### Data Connections

Data connections may be brought through the hatch and connected directly to the internal computer. Both
of Jackal's internal computer options support USB3 and Ethernet connectivity. With the performance
PC, the PCIe slot may be used to supply Firewire, Thunderbolt, or additional USB3 ports, as necessary.

Additionally, the internal mounting area may be used for an Ethernet switch, when attaching multiple
Ethernet payloads, or for a PoE power injector as required.


#### Connector Summary

The Jackal User Power Board (UPB) board provides a number of connections for power.
These are summarized in the following table and described in more detail in the following sections.

- For the High Current VBAT User Power, terminate your payload's power lead with the appropriate terminals.
- For the User Power Ports, terminate your payload's power lead with the appropriate crimps and pins.
for the four pin Molex connector. This option may be best if you are removing your payload from Jackal frequently.
- For the User Power Screw Terminals, pull out the black terminal block, and use a small screwdriver to securely attach power leads to it.
Confirm voltage and polarity before reconnecting the terminal block.

#### User Power Connections

Similar to the data connections, power leads may be brought through the hatch, and connected to the User Power Board.
The following are available as user power:

- unregulated VBAT power (25.6 V nominal, 16 A max), shared across the High Current VBAT User Power (16 A max),
  User Power Ports (8 A max per port) and the User Power Screw Terminals (15 A max)
- regulated 12 V power (7 A max), shared across the User Power ports (7 A max per port) and the User Power
  Screw Terminals (7 A max)
- regulated 5 V power (5 A max), shared across the User Power ports (5 A max per port) and the User Power
  Screw Terminals (5 A max).

:::caution

Each User Power Port (Molex 0039301040) has a shared ground (GND) pin with a maximum current rating of 8 A. Ensure
that the combined current draw for the VBAT, 12V, and 5V pins for the corresponding GND
pin does not exceed 8 A.

## Lead-Acid Battery Care

Dingo's default power supply is a sealed 12 V lead-acid battery pack (VRLA), providing 20 Ah of charge.
These tips are intended to help keep your Dingo Lead-Acid Battery in tip-top shape.
With proper maintenance, the battery should maintain the majority of its capacity for hundreds of cycles.

## Software Maintenance  {#software_maintenance}

:::note

If you are upgrading your Dingo from an older version of ROS, please refer to our upgrade instructions [here](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/kinetic-to-melodic/index.html) and [here](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html).

### Getting New Packages

Dingo is always being improved, both its own software and the many community ROS packages upon which it depends!
You can use the `apt` package management system to receive new versions all software running on the platform.

Each Dingo leaves the factory already configured to pull packages from http://packages.ros.org as well as http://packages.clearpathrobotics.com.
To update your package and download new package versions, simply run:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

### MCU Firmware Update

Customer updates of Dingo firmware are not supported at this time.
Contact [Support](#support) if Dingo firmware updates are needed.

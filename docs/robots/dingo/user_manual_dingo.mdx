#### HMI Details

The human-machine-interface (HMI) panel is shown below and includes from left:
-   motor stop button: LED is solid green when Dingo is able to drive and flashing green when the Dingo's
    motors are disengaged; pressing button toggles the motors between engaged and disengaged mode (further
    details in [Motor Stop Buttons](#dingo-stop-buttons)); 
-   comms indictor: LED is solid green when communication between the MCU and computer has been established
    and LED is off otherwise;
-   wifi indicator: LED is solid green when wifi is connected and LED is off otherwise;
-   battery indicator: LED is solid green when the battery level is ok (above 30% ?), solid red when the battery
    level is getting low (between 10-30%(?) -- start charging soon), and flashing red when the battery level is
    critical (below 10%(?) -- begin charging immediately);
-   system power button: LED is solid blue when the system powered on and running and the LED is flashing blue during
    the shutdown process; when the system is powered off, pressing the power button begins the power on process;
    when the system is powered on, a quick press of the power button begins a graceful shutdown and a prolonged
    press of the power button triggers and immediate power off of the system.

#### Corner LEDs and System State

Dingo is equipped with LEDs at the four corners of the robot, which indicate the state of the system:

| System State                      | Corner LED Output       |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| Normal mode                       | Front LEDs solid white, rear LEDs solid red |
| Low battery                       | Flashing yellow LEDs    |
| System fault                      | Solid red LEDs          |
| TODO: Others?                     | TODO                    |

#### Optional Shore Power

Dingo does provide an optional shore power connection to allow the system to be powered without requiring batteries
to be present. Note that when shore power is connected, the motors are disabled and it is not possible to drive the
Dingo; however, all other electronics (computers, sensors, etc) will remain enabled.

To connect the shore power, remove the top trough cover (to access the MCU) and then attach the shore power cable
to the 2-port connector labelled "SHORE" on the MCU (see [Electrical Integration](#dingo-payload-electrical-integration)
for details).

### System Architecture

Dingo is built around a computer running Ubuntu (Intel-based computer or Jetson developer kit), paired with a 32-bit MCU.
The MCU handles I/O, power supply monitoring, and motor control, as well as supplying data from the integrated IMU.
The communication channel between the MCU and computer is a Gigabit Ethernet connection.

The key topics which comprise Dingo's ROS API are outlined in the table below.

| Topic                             | Message Type            | Purpose                                                                          |

## Getting Started

### Powering Up
The first step is to power up your Dingo and have some fun driving it around! If you've just unpacked Dingo from its
packaging, you may need to open it up and connect the battery.

Press the power button (TODO: inline image) on Dingo's HMI panel. The LEDs should show a test pattern, after which
you will wait about 30 seconds for the internal computer to finish booting up.

### Connecting the Bluetooth Controller
When the comms LED (TODO: inline image) is green, this signals that the computer is finished booting up, and that the
computer and MCU are in communication. At this point, press the PS button on the Sony Bluetooth controller to sync the
controller to Dingo. Once the blue LED on the top of the controller goes solid, you are paired and ready to drive.
Hold the L1 trigger button (deadman switch), and push the left thumbstick forward to drive the Dingo. For full speed
mode, hold the R1 trigger. See the figure below for the Sony PS4 controls layout. If you are not seeing any action,
refer to (TODO: Contact on page 19) to get in touch with support.

### Configuring Wireless Access

#### Wired Access to Dingo

To get Dingo connected to your local wifi network, you must first access the internal computer using a wired connection.
Remove the top trough cover and the appropriate yellow fairing to access the computer module, then connect to one of
the network ports with a standard ethernet cable.

Set your laptop's ethernet port to a static IP such as 192.168.131.201. To do this in Ubuntu, follow the steps below:

1.  Click on the Wifi icon in the upper-right corner of your screen, and select Edit Connections.
2.  In the Network Connections window, under Ethernet, select your wired connection and then click Edit.
3.  Select the IPv4 Settings tab and then change the Method to Manual.
4.  Click the Add button to add a new address.
5.  Enter a 192.168.131.201 as the static IP under the Address column, and enter 255.255.255.0 under the NetMask
    column, and then select Save.

      width="400"
    />
    <figcaption>Static IP Configuration (Ubuntu)</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The next step is to connect to Dingo via SSH. To do so execute the following in a terminal window:

`ssh administrator@192.168.131.1`

You will be promoted to enter a password. The default password is provided in the Quick Start guide that shipped
with your system.

#### Dingo Wifi Setup

Now that you are connected via SSH over a wired connection using the steps above, you can set up  the Dingo computer
(running Ubuntu 20.04) to connect to a local wifi network. (For legacy Dingo systems running Ubuntu 18.04, use
`wicd-curses` instead.)

TODO: netplan details.

While you are still connected via SSH over a wired connection to Dingo, you willl need to identify the IP address
of Dingo's wireless connection. In a terminal window, execute:

`ip a`

A list of network connections will be displayed within the terminal. Locate the wireless network and make note of its
IP address. Now that you know Dingo's wireless IP address, you may now exit the ethernet SSH session by executing
`exit`.

Remove the ethernet cable and close up Dingo. Now you can SSH into Dingo over the wireless network. To do so,
execute:

`ssh administrator@<IP_OF_DINGO>`

SSH sessions allow you to control Dingo's internal computer. You can do various things such as download packages,
run updates, add/remove files, transfer files etc.

### Remote ROS Connectivity

To use ROS desktop tools, you will need your computer to be able to connect to Dingo's ROS master. This will allow
you to run ROS commands like `rostopic list`, `rostopic echo`, `rosnode list`, and others, from a remote PC and the
output will reflect the activity on Dingo's ROS master, rather than on your own machine. This can be a tricky
process, but we have tried to make it as simple as possible.

In order for the ROS tools on your computer to talk to Dingo, they need to know two things:

-   How to find the ROS master, which is set in the `ROS_MASTER_URI` environment variable, and
-   How processes on the other computer can find your computer, which is the `ROS_IP` environment variable.

The suggested pattern is to create a file in your home directory called `remote-dingo.sh` with the following contents:

`export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://cpr-dingo -0001:11311 # Dingo's hostname`
`export ROS_IP=10.25.0.102 # Your laptop's wireless IP address`

If your network does not already resolve Dingo's hostname to its wireless IP address, you may need to add a
corresponding line to your computer's `/etc/hosts` file:

`10.25.0.101 cpr-dingo-0001`

NOTE: You can verify the hostname and IP address of Dingo using the following commands during an SSH session
with the onboard PC.

`hostname`
`hostname -i`

Then, when you are ready to communicate remotely with Dingo, you can source that script like so, thus defining
those two key environment variables in the present context.

`source remote-dingo.sh`

To verify that everything is set up propelry, try running a few ROS commands, such as the standard visual ROS tools:

`roslaunch dingo_viz view_robot.launch`
`rosrun rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor`
`rosrun rqt_console rqt_console`

If the tools launch, then everything is setup properly.

Please contact Clearpath Support if you need assistance in configuring remote access. For more general details on
how ROS works over TCP with multiple machines, please see:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines.

For help troubleshooting a multiple machines connectivity issue, see:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup

### Dingo Desktop Packages

To command or observe Dingo from your desktop computer, first set up a basic ROS installation. See the following
page for details:
http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/installation/ubuntu

When your ROS install is set up, install the Dingo desktop packages:

`sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-dingo-desktop`

Once your remote access to Dingo's ROS master is configured (see options in subsection TODO), you can launch rviz,
the standard ROS robot visualization tool:

`roslaunch dingo_viz view_robot.launch`

From within rviz, you can use interactive markers to drive Dingo, you can visualize its published localization
estimate, and you can visualize any attached sensors which have been added to its robot description XML (URDF).

Additionally from the desktop, you can launch the standard RQT Robot Monitor, which watches the diagnostic output
from Dingo's self-montoring capabilities:

`rosrun rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor`

## Apps

When equipped with a laser scanner as is available in the Gazebo simulation, Dingo works with the standard ROS
navigation stack. See http://wiki.ros.org/dingo_navigation.

---

## Charging and Battery Maintenance

When finished with the Dingo, press and release the power button (TODO: image) to power it off. Then remove the
batteries for charging.

Dingo's batteries are charged outside the Dingo using the charger(s) provided.

Alternatively, if you have multiple batteries, you can hot-swap them one at a time. The system will remain operational
while hot-swapping as long as there is at least one battery in the system or the system is connected to shore power
prior to removing the batteries. Note that plugging in shore power will engage a motor stop and it is not possible to
drive Dingo while connected to shore power.

The Sealed Lead Acid batteries have overcurrent protection in the form of an ATO fuse. The Lithium-Ion batteries include
integrated protections against fault due to overcurrent, overdischarge, and short circuit. The batteries are rugged and
designed for the demanding environments into which Dingo may be deployed.

However, please take note of the following:

-   SLA batteries must be charged while in a 0 to +45 ◦C range and discharged while in a -30 to +60 ◦C range.
-   Li-Ion batteries must be charged while in a 0 to +50 ◦C range and discharged while in a -20 to +60 ◦C range.
-   The batteries must not be punctured or disassembled.
-   The batteries should be dropped off or delivered to your local hazardous waste authority for disposal.
-   When traveling with Dingo, consult your airline's restrictions regarding lithium batteries (if applicable). If
possible, bring the batteries in your carry on luggage, where they will be subject to normal cabin temperatures and
pressures.

Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Dingo's batteries or for information about purchasing
additional batteries.

## Safety Considerations

Dingo is a fast moving robotic platform. Please read the following notices carefully.

### General warnings

Dingo is a rugged and high-performance vehicle. For the safety of yourself and others, always conduct initial
experiments and software development with the vehicle raised off the ground. Place a wooden crate, a set of
sawhorses, a sturdy storage tub, or any other solid flat structure having a height greater than 6 inches under
Dingo to keep the wheels clear of the ground ("up on blocks").

When starting out, favor slower wheel speeds. Dingo's control loops can accurately maintain velocities as low
as 0.1 m/s. Operating at such speeds will give you more time to react if things don't go quite as you expect.

### Motor Stop Buttons  {#dingo-stop-buttons}

The motor stop button (TODO: image) is located on the HMI Panel at the back of Dingo. To engage Stop Mode,
press the motor stop button once; you should see that the green LED by the motor stop button is flashing and
that all four corner LEDs are flashing red. To disengage Stop Mode, press the motor stop button again; all
LEDs should return to their original values.

When in Stop Mode, the Dingo will not drive. The commands received while in Stop Mode are not buffered; Dingo will
always act on the latest commands received. This means that if the commands are stopped before the motor stop
button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode, the Dingo will not move. If the commands are continued, Dingo will move
at the speed commanded once the motor stop button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode.

Ensure that the motor stop button is accessible at all times. Avoid mounting payloads that extend over the rear of
Dingo and would block access to the motor stop button.

Note that the Dingo MCU board does provide a breakout to allow an external stop button/switch to be integrated by
the end user, which could be used to engage/disengage Stop Mode. Please inquire with Clearpath Robotics for details
on adding an external stop button/switch. See section TODO for information.

### Electrical System

Dingo is powered by batteries capable of delivering over 2000W for short durations. This gives Dingo's motors their
great performance; however, it is also enough power to cause severe bodily harm. Always use caution when operating
Dingo to avoid personal injury or property damage. To ensure safety, please observe the following precautions:

-   Do not tamper with the battery terminals or wiring.
-   Do not tamper with the fuses, except to check and change the fuses.
-   Always replace fuses with the same type and rating to ensure continued protection against risk of fires.
-   Consult Clearpath Robotics support if you need to service the batteries.
-   Do not lay tools or other objects on top of the batteries.
-   Charge the battery only with the charger provided by Clearpath Robotics.
-   Please dispose of the batteries properly or return them to Clearpath Robotics to do so.

### Lifting and Transport

-   Ensure that Dingo's Stop Mode is engaged when transporting short distances and powered off when transporting
longer distances.
-   Do not push the robot at more than 0.5 m/s (1.6 ft/s) or damage to the motor controls may occur.

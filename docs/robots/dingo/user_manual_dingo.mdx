#### HMI Details

The human-machine-interface (HMI) panel is shown below and includes from left:

- **motor stop button**: LED is solid green when Dingo is able to drive and flashing green when the Dingo's
  motors are disengaged; pressing button toggles the motors between engaged and disengaged mode (further
  details in [Motor Stop Buttons](#dingo-stop-buttons));
- **comms indictor**: LED is solid green when communication between the MCU and computer has been established
  and LED is off otherwise;
- **wifi indicator**: LED is solid green when wifi is connected and LED is off otherwise;
- **battery indicator**: LED is solid green when the battery level is ok,
  solid yellow when the battery level is getting low (should be charged soon),
  and solid red when the battery level is critical (should be charged immediately);
- **system power button**: LED is solid blue when the system powered on and running and the LED is flashing blue during
  the shutdown process; when the system is powered off, pressing the power button begins the power on process;
  when the system is powered on, a quick press of the power button begins a graceful shutdown and a prolonged
  press of the power button triggers and immediate power off of the system.

#### Corner LEDs and System State

Dingo is equipped with LEDs at the four corners of the robot, which indicate the state of the system:

| System State       | Corner LED Output                                                                 |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Idle               | Front LEDs solid white (low intensity), rear LEDs solid red (low intensity)       |
| Driving            | Front LEDs solid white (medium intensity), rear LEDs solid red (medium intensity) |
| Motor stop engaged | Flashing red LEDs                                                                 |
| Low battery        | Pulsing orange LEDs                                                               |
| Needs reset        | Adjacent corners alternating between red and off                                  |
| System fault       | Flashing orange LEDs                                                              |

While in "Idle" and "Driving" states, the user can override the LEDs by publishing to the `/mcu/lights` topic.

#### Optional Shore Power

Dingo does provide an optional shore power connection to allow the system to be powered without requiring batteries
to be present. Note that when shore power is connected, the motors are disabled and it is not possible to drive the
Dingo; however, all other electronics (computers, sensors, etc) will remain enabled.

To connect the shore power, remove the top trough cover (to access the MCU) and then attach the shore power cable
to the 2-port connector labelled "SHORE" on the MCU (see [Electrical Integration](#dingo-payload-electrical-integration)
for details).

### System Architecture

Dingo is built around a computer running Ubuntu (Intel-based computer or Jetson developer kit), paired with a 32-bit MCU.
The MCU handles I/O, power supply monitoring, and motor control, as well as supplying data from the integrated IMU.
The communication channel between the MCU and computer is a Gigabit Ethernet connection.

The key topics which comprise Dingo's ROS API are outlined in the table below.

| Topic             | Message Type          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Getting Started

### Powering Up

The first step is to power up your Dingo and have some fun driving it around! If you've just unpacked Dingo from its
packaging, you may need to open it up and connect the battery.

Press the power button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-power.png" width="20" /> on
Dingo's HMI panel. The LEDs should show a test pattern, after which you will wait about 30 seconds for the
internal computer to finish booting up.

### Connecting the Bluetooth Controller

When the comms LED <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-comms.png" width="20" />
is green, this signals that the computer is finished booting up, and that the
computer and MCU are in communication. At this point, press the PS button on the Sony Bluetooth controller to sync the
controller to Dingo. Once the blue LED on the top of the controller goes solid, you are paired and ready to drive.
Hold the L1 trigger button (deadman switch), and push the left thumbstick forward to drive the Dingo. For full speed
mode, hold the R1 trigger. See the figure below for the Sony PS4 controls layout. If you are not seeing any action,
refer to [Support](#dingo-support) to get in touch with support.

      width="600"
    />
    <figcaption>PS4 Controls Layout</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

### Configuring Wireless Access

#### Wired Access to Dingo

To get Dingo connected to your local wifi network, you must first access the internal computer using a wired connection.
Remove the top trough cover and the appropriate yellow fairing to access the computer module, then connect to one of
the network ports with a standard ethernet cable.

Set your laptop's ethernet port to a static IP such as 192.168.131.101. To do this in Ubuntu, follow the steps below:

1.  Click on the Wifi icon in the upper-right corner of your screen, and select Edit Connections.
2.  In the Network Connections window, under Ethernet, select your wired connection and then click Edit.
3.  Select the IPv4 Settings tab and then change the Method to Manual.
4.  Click the Add button to add a new address.
5.  Enter a 192.168.131.101 as the static IP under the Address column, and enter 255.255.255.0 under the Netmask
    column, and then select Save.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/wired_connection.png"
      width="400"
    />
    <figcaption>Static IP Configuration (Ubuntu)</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The next step is to connect to Dingo via SSH. To do so execute the following in a terminal window:

`ssh administrator@192.168.131.1`

You will be promoted to enter a password. The default password is `clearpath` and you set a new password
on first connection.

#### Dingo Wifi Setup

Now that you are connected via SSH over a wired connection using the steps above, you can set up the Dingo computer
(running Ubuntu 20.04) to connect to a local wifi network. (For legacy Dingo systems running Ubuntu 18.04, use
`wicd-curses` instead.)

<ComponentNetplanSetup />

Now that you know robot's wireless IP address, you may now exit the ethernet SSH session by executing
`exit`.

Remove the ethernet cable and close up Dingo. Now you can SSH into Dingo over the wireless network. To do so,
execute:

`ssh administrator@<IP_OF_DINGO>`

SSH sessions allow you to control Dingo's internal computer. You can do various things such as download packages,
run updates, add/remove files, transfer files etc.

### Remote ROS Connectivity

To use ROS desktop tools, you will need your computer to be able to connect to Dingo's ROS master. This will allow
you to run ROS commands like `rostopic list`, `rostopic echo`, `rosnode list`, and others, from a remote PC and the
output will reflect the activity on Dingo's ROS master, rather than on your own machine. This can be a tricky
process, but we have tried to make it as simple as possible.

In order for the ROS tools on your computer to talk to Dingo, they need to know two things:

- How to find the ROS master, which is set in the `ROS_MASTER_URI` environment variable, and
- How processes on the other computer can find your computer, which is the `ROS_IP` environment variable.

The suggested pattern is to create a file in your home directory called `remote-dingo.sh` with the following contents:

```
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://cpr-dingo -0001:11311 # Dingo's hostname
export ROS_IP=10.25.0.102 # Your laptop's wireless IP address
```

If your network does not already resolve Dingo's hostname to its wireless IP address, you may need to add a
corresponding line to your computer's `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.25.0.101 cpr-dingo-0001
```

NOTE: You can verify the hostname and IP address of Dingo using the following commands during an SSH session
with the onboard PC.

```
hostname
hostname -i
```

Then, when you are ready to communicate remotely with Dingo, you can source that script like so, thus defining
those two key environment variables in the present context.

```
source remote-dingo.sh
```

To verify that everything is set up propelry, try running a few ROS commands, such as the standard visual ROS tools:

```
roslaunch dingo_viz view_robot.launch
rosrun rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor
rosrun rqt_console rqt_console
```

If the tools launch, then everything is setup properly.

Please contact Clearpath Support if you need assistance in configuring remote access. For more general details on
how ROS works over TCP with multiple machines, please see:
<http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines>.

For help troubleshooting a multiple machines connectivity issue, see:
<http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup>

### Dingo Desktop Packages

To command or observe Dingo from your desktop computer, first set up a basic ROS installation. See the following
page for details:
<http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/installation/ubuntu>

When your ROS install is set up, install the Dingo desktop packages:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-dingo-desktop
```

Once your remote access to Dingo's ROS master is configured (see above), you can launch RViz,
the standard ROS robot visualization tool:

```
roslaunch dingo_viz view_robot.launch
```

From within RViz, you can use interactive markers to drive Dingo, you can visualize its published localization
estimate, and you can visualize any attached sensors which have been added to its robot description XML (URDF).

Additionally from the desktop, you can launch the standard RQT Robot Monitor, which watches the diagnostic output
from Dingo's self-montoring capabilities:

```
rosrun rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor
```

---

## Apps

When equipped with a laser scanner as is available in the Gazebo simulation, Dingo works with the standard ROS
navigation stack. See <http://wiki.ros.org/dingo_navigation>.

---

## Charging and Battery Maintenance

When finished with the Dingo, press and release the power button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-power.png" width="20" />
to power it off. Then remove the batteries for charging.

Dingo's batteries are charged outside the Dingo using the charger(s) provided.

Alternatively, if you have multiple batteries, you can hot-swap them one at a time. The system will remain operational
while hot-swapping as long as there is at least one battery in the system or the system is connected to shore power
prior to removing the batteries. Note that plugging in shore power will engage a motor stop and it is not possible to
drive Dingo while connected to shore power.

The Sealed Lead Acid batteries have overcurrent protection in the form of an ATO fuse. The Lithium-Ion batteries include
integrated protections against fault due to overcurrent, overdischarge, and short circuit. The batteries are rugged and
designed for the demanding environments into which Dingo may be deployed.

However, please take note of the following:

- SLA batteries must be charged while in a 0 to +45 ◦C range and discharged while in a -30 to +60 ◦C range.
- Li-Ion batteries must be charged while in a 0 to +50 ◦C range and discharged while in a -20 to +60 ◦C range.
- The batteries must not be punctured or disassembled.
- The batteries should be dropped off or delivered to your local hazardous waste authority for disposal.
- When traveling with Dingo, consult your airline's restrictions regarding lithium batteries (if applicable). If
  possible, bring the batteries in your carry on luggage, where they will be subject to normal cabin temperatures and
  pressures.

Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Dingo's batteries or for information about purchasing
additional batteries.

## Safety Considerations

Dingo is a fast moving robotic platform. Please read the following notices carefully.

### General warnings

Dingo is a rugged and high-performance vehicle. For the safety of yourself and others, always conduct initial
experiments and software development with the vehicle raised off the ground. Place a wooden crate, a set of
sawhorses, a sturdy storage tub, or any other solid flat structure having a height greater than 6 inches under
Dingo to keep the wheels clear of the ground ("up on blocks").

When starting out, favor slower wheel speeds. Dingo's control loops can accurately maintain velocities as low
as 0.1 m/s. Operating at such speeds will give you more time to react if things don't go quite as you expect.

### Motor Stop Buttons {#dingo-stop-buttons}

The motor stop button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-motor.png" width="20" />
is located on the HMI Panel at the back of Dingo. To engage Stop Mode,
press the motor stop button once; you should see that the green LED by the motor stop button is flashing and
that all four corner LEDs are flashing red. To disengage Stop Mode, press the motor stop button again; all
LEDs should return to their original values.

When in Stop Mode, the Dingo will not drive. The commands received while in Stop Mode are not buffered; Dingo will
always act on the latest commands received. This means that if the commands are stopped before the motor stop
button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode, the Dingo will not move. If the commands are continued, Dingo will move
at the speed commanded once the motor stop button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode.

Ensure that the motor stop button is accessible at all times. Avoid mounting payloads that extend over the rear of
Dingo and would block access to the motor stop button.

Note that the Dingo MCU board does provide a breakout to allow an external stop button/switch to be integrated by
the end user, which could be used to engage/disengage Stop Mode. See [Optional External E-Stop](#dingo-external-estop)
for details on adding an external stop button/switch.

### Electrical System

Dingo is powered by batteries capable of delivering over 2000W for short durations. This gives Dingo's motors their
great performance; however, it is also enough power to cause severe bodily harm. Always use caution when operating
Dingo to avoid personal injury or property damage. To ensure safety, please observe the following precautions:

- Do not tamper with the battery terminals or wiring.
- Do not tamper with the fuses, except to check and change the fuses.
- Always replace fuses with the same type and rating to ensure continued protection against risk of fires.
- Consult Clearpath Robotics support if you need to service the batteries.
- Do not lay tools or other objects on top of the batteries.
- Charge the battery only with the charger provided by Clearpath Robotics.
- Please dispose of the batteries properly or return them to Clearpath Robotics to do so.

### Lifting and Transport

- Ensure that Dingo's Stop Mode is engaged when transporting short distances and powered off when transporting
  longer distances.
- Do not push the robot at more than 0.5 m/s (1.6 ft/s) or damage to the motor controls may occur.

## Payload Integration Guide

If you are wanting to attach custom hardware to Dingo, you will have to take care of mechanical mounting, electrical
supply, and software integration. This section aims to equip you with respect to these challenges.

### Mechanical Mounting

External payloads can be attached to the 80 mm square mounting holes on Dingo's
trough cover as shown in [Exterior Features](#dingo-exterior-features).
The mounting holes come with M5 screws pre-installed. You may mount your hardware directly
onto the trough cover or you may design and mount a new plate to the trough cover and
secure it to the trough cover using M5 screws.

### Electrical Integration {#dingo-payload-electrical-integration}

Except for bus-powered USB cameras, most payloads have separate leads for power and data.

#### Data Connections

Data connections may be brought through the openings in the trough cover and connected directly to
the internal computer.

Dingo's internal computer options support USB3 and Ethernet connectivity. In addition,
the PCIe Gen3 x16 slot may be used to supply a GPU or other attachements, as necessary.
Additionally, the internal mounting area may be used for an Ethernet switch, when attaching multiple
Ethernet payloads, or for a PoE power injector as required.

#### Connector Summary

The Dingo MCU board provides a number of connections for power, relays, auxiliary inputs and
auxiliary outputs. These are summarized in the following table and described in more detail in
the following sections.

| MCU board label  | MCU board connector | Mating connector | Crimp terminals                                              | Crimping tool    |

#### User Power Connections

The following are available as user power: unregulated battery power (see VBAT), regulated 12V power
(see PWR1 and PWR2), and regulated 5V power (see PWR1 and PWR2).

Similar to the data connections, the power leads may be brought through the trough cover and connected
to the user power. Remove the front trough cover by removing four flathead screws and locate the appropriate power
connector on the MCU board. Refer to the figure below for the location of the user power connectors.
Route the power from the MCU board to the appropriate location, either to the internal
payload modules or through the openings in the trough cover to the topside payload.

  </figure>
</center>

#### AUX Inputs {#dingo-aux-inputs}

The Dingo MCU includes an 8-pin `INPUTS` connector and a 2-pin `SW_IN` connector
that allow the user to provide inputs to the system. The user can then subscribe to
these inputs on the `/mcu/aux_inputs` ROS topic. The AUX inputs
are mapped to the ROS message bits as follows:

- IN1: bit 0
- IN2: bit 1
- IN3: bit 2

Electrically, the `INPUTS` connector is used for IN1 and IN2, with pin mapping as
outlined below. Note that each of the two inputs can be 12V or 24V inputs, with a
shared return path. The inputs have opto-electrical isolation.

- 1: 12V power (for external input circuit, if needed)
- 2: IN1 return
- 3: GND (for external input circuit, if needed)
- 4: IN2 return
- 5: IN1 12V input
- 6: IN1 24V input
- 7: IN2 12V input
- 8: IN2 24V input

Electrically, the `SW_IN` connector is used for IN3, with pin mapping as outlined
below. This is intended to be a 'switch' input and it generates a 100 ms pulse
to the microcontroller when asserted.

- 1: 3.3V input (IN3)
- 2: GND

#### AUX Outputs and Relay {#dingo-aux-outputs}

The Dingo MCU includes three user-controlled outputs (AUX1, AUX2, AUX3), that
can be controlled by publishing to the `/mcu/aux_outputs` ROS topic. To enable
the AUX outputs, simply publish a single message with the appropriate bits set
to 1 to turn the output on and 0 to turn it off. The state does not persist
meaning new commands will need to keep the bit enabled as well. The AUX outputs
are mapped to the ROS message bits as follows:

- AUX1: bit 0
- AUX2: bit 1
- AUX3: bit 2

For example, to disable all AUX outputs:

```
rostopic pub /mcu/aux_output std_msgs/UInt8 "data: 0"
```

For example, to enable all AUX outputs:

```
rostopic pub /mcu/aux_output std_msgs/UInt8 "data: 7"
```

For example, to enable just the AUX3 output:

```
rostopic pub /mcu/aux_output std_msgs/UInt8 "data: 4"
```

Each of the AUX outputs is a 4-pin connector with pin mapping as outlined below.

**AUX1 Pin Mapping**

- 1: VSYS (shore power or battery power) with 5A fuse
- 2: VSYS (shore power or battery power) with 5A fuse
- 3: GND
- 4: GND

**AUX2 Pin Mapping**

- 1: 12V with 5A fuse
- 2: 12V with 5A fuse
- 3: GND
- 4: GND

**AUX3 Pin Mapping**

- 1: 5V with 5A fuse
- 2: 5V with 5A fuse
- 3: GND
- 4: GND

**Relays**

In addition to the AUX output connectors, publishing to `/mcu/aux_outputs` also
controls the AUX relays. These relays are available through the 10-pin
connector on the MCU labelled `RELAY` with pin mapping:

- 1 and 6: 12V with 2A fuse
- 5 and 10: GND
- 2 and 7: AUX1 relay closed with aux_outputs bit 0 is '1'
- 3 and 8: AUX2 relay closed with aux_outputs bit 1 is '1'
- 4 and 9: AUX3 relay closed with aux_outputs bit 2 is '1'

#### Optional Fan {#dingo-fan}

While a fan is not included by default with Dingo, a fan may be integrated into the system.
Electrically, connect a 12V 2-pin fan to the MCU connector labelled `FAN`
using a mating connector. The pins should be connected as follows:

- 1: 12V
- 2: GND

Then, the use can publish a ROS message to the `/mcu/fans` topic to control the fan.

#### Optional External E-Stop {#dingo-external-estop}

In addition to the built-in Motor Stop button, an external e-stop button can be added that has Similar
functionality. Electrically, the external e-stop button can be connected to the 6-pin MCU connector
labelled `ESTOP` using a mating connector.

The six pins should be connected as follows:

- 1-2: to external e-stop breakout: press and release external button (3.3V) to engage estop; press and release
  external button or motor stop button to clear the e-stop
- 3-4: short these pins to indicate that external estop is selected
- 5-6: short these pins to indicate that external estop is present

#### MCU Debug LEDs

The Dingo MCU PCBA comes equipped with four LEDs controlled by Dingo firmware for debugging.
If the system is working properly, these LEDs functions as follows:

- **DBG1**: toggles every 500ms when main loop on MCU is running
- **DBG2**: on if MCU connected to ROS on computer; else false (same as COMMS LED on HMI)
- **DBG3**: toggles when MCU is relaying messages from CAN bus to computer
- **DBG4**: toggles when MCU is relaying messages from computer to CAN bus

### Software Integration

ROS has a large ecosystem of sensor drivers, some of which include pre-made URDF descriptions and
even simulation configurations. Please see the following page on the ROS wiki for a partial list:

<http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors>

For the best experience, consider purchasing supported accessories from Clearpath Robotics for your
Dingo, which will include simulation, visualization, and driver support. However, we will happily
assist you in integrating your own devices as well.

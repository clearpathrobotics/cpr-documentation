#### Corner LEDs and System State

Dingo is equipped with LEDs at the four corners of the robot, which indicate the state of the system:

| System State        | Corner LED Output                                                                 |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Idle                | Front LEDs solid white (low intensity), rear LEDs solid red (low intensity)       |
| Driving             | Front LEDs solid white (medium intensity), rear LEDs solid red (medium intensity) |
| Motion stop engaged | Flashing red LEDs                                                                 |
| Low battery         | Pulsing orange LEDs                                                               |
| Needs reset         | Adjacent corners alternating between red and off                                  |
| System fault        | Flashing orange LEDs                                                              |

While in "Idle" and "Driving" states, the user can override the LEDs by publishing to the `/mcu/lights` topic.

#### Optional Shore Power

Dingo does provide an optional shore power connection to allow the system to be powered without requiring batteries to be present.
Note that when shore power is connected, the motors are disabled and it is not possible to drive the Dingo; however, all other electronics (computers, sensors, etc) will remain enabled.

To connect the shore power, remove the top trough cover (to access the MCU) and then attach the shore power cable to the 2-port connector labelled "SHORE" on the MCU (see [Electrical Integration](#dingo-payload-electrical-integration) for details).

#### Orientation References

The reference frame used by all Clearpath Robotics ground robots is based on ISO 8855, and is shown in the figure below.
Husky's front is shown. When commanded with a positive translational velocity (forward), wheels travel in the positive x-direction.
The direction of the axes differs from those used for roll, pitch, and yaw in aircraft, and care should be taken to ensure that data is interpreted correctly.

## Getting Started

You are ready to go! This section details how to get Dingo into action.
To begin, place Dingo "up on blocks" as described in the [Safety](#safety) section, making sure that the wheels are clear of the ground.

For most Dingo setups, there will be an Onboard Computer which is directly connected to the Dingo and a Remote Computer which is used to control Dingo and gather data.
These two computers must be set up to communicate with each other.

### Onboard Computer Setup

If you purchased an Onboard Computer from Clearpath Robotics with Dingo, it is already installed, connected, and powered.
If not, or to set up your own Onboard Computer, see the [Dingo Tutorials](/docs/robots/dingo/tutorials_dingo).

Note that the Onboard Computer must be connected to Dingo's Ethernet port, which is accessible in the center channel.

### Powering Up

If you've just unpacked Dingo from its packaging, you may need to open it up and connect the battery.

Press the power button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-power.png" width="20" /> on Dingo's HMI panel.
The LEDs should show a test pattern, after which you will wait about 30 seconds for the internal computer to finish booting up.
Once it has finished booting, the Comms indicator <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-comms.png" width="20" /> should turn green.
This indicates that ROS is up on the computer and has established communications with the Dingo base.

### Network Configuration

To get Dingo connected to your local Wi-Fi network, you must first access the Onboard Computer using a wired connection to the robot.
Remove the top trough cover and the appropriate yellow fairing to access the computer module, then connect to one of the network ports with a standard Ethernet cable.
See the [Dingo Tutorials](/docs/robots/dingo/tutorials_dingo#dingo-networking) for details.

### Connecting and Using the Controller {#controller}

To use your controller, it must be paired with your Dingo and powered on.
If your purchased the Onboard Computer from Clearpath Robotics, your controller is already paired with your Dingo.
If your controller has become unpaired or if you wish to pair a new controller, following the instructions in the [Dingo Tutorials](/docs/robots/dingo/tutorials_dingo#pairing-the-controller).

To teleoperate Dingo, first clear the motion-stop.
Then, power on the controller by pressing the `PS` button on the controller.
Once the blue LED on the top of the controller goes solid, you are paired and ready to drive.

Press the PS button on the Sony Bluetooth controller to sync the controller to Dingo.
Once the blue LED on the top of the controller goes solid, you are paired and ready to drive.
Hold the L1 trigger button (deadman switch) and push the left thumbstick forward to drive the Dingo.
For full speed mode, hold the R1 trigger.
See the figure below for the Sony PS4 controls layout.
If you are not seeing any action, refer to [Support](#dingo-support) to get in touch with support.

### Using ROS

<ComponentUsingRos />

### Battery Charging

When finished with the Dingo, press and release the power button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-power.png" width="20" /> to power it off.
Then remove the batteries for charging.

Dingo's batteries are charged outside the Dingo using the charger(s) provided.

Alternatively, if you have multiple batteries, you can hot-swap them one at a time.
The system will remain operational while hot-swapping as long as there is at least one battery in the system or the system is connected to shore power prior to removing the batteries.
Note that plugging in shore power will engage a motion-stop and it is not possible to drive Dingo while connected to shore power.

The Sealed Lead-Acid batteries have overcurrent protection in the form of an ATO fuse.
The Lithium-Ion batteries include integrated protections against fault due to overcurrent, overdischarge, and short circuit.
The batteries are rugged and designed for the demanding environments into which Dingo may be deployed.

However, please take note of the following:

- SLA batteries must be charged while in a 0 to +45 ◦C range and discharged while in a -30 to +60 ◦C range.
- Li-Ion batteries must be charged while in a 0 to +50 ◦C range and discharged while in a -20 to +60 ◦C range.
- The batteries must not be punctured or disassembled.
- The batteries should be dropped off or delivered to your local hazardous waste authority for disposal.
- When traveling with Dingo, consult your airline's restrictions regarding lithium batteries (if applicable).
  If possible, bring the batteries in your carry on luggage, where they will be subject to normal cabin temperatures and pressures.

Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Dingo's batteries or for information about purchasing additional batteries.

## Safety Considerations {#safety}

Clearpath Robotics is committed to high standards of safety.
Dingo contains several features to protect the safety of users and the integrity of the robot.

:::caution

Dingo is a fast moving robotic platform. Please read the following notices carefully.

:::

### General warnings

Dingo is a rugged and high-performance vehicle.
For the safety of yourself and others, always conduct initial experiments and software development with the vehicle raised off the ground.
Place a wooden crate, a set of sawhorses, a sturdy storage tub, or any other solid flat structure having a height greater than 150 mm (6 inches) under Dingo to keep the wheels clear of the ground ("up on blocks").

When starting out, favour slower wheel speeds.
Dingo's control loops can accurately maintain velocities as low as 0.1 m/s.
Operating at such speeds will give you more time to react if things don't go quite as you expect.

### Motion Stop Buttons {#dingo-stop-buttons}

The Motion Stop button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-motor.png" width="20" /> is located on the HMI Panel at the back of Dingo.
To engage Stop Mode, press the Motion Stop button once; you should see that the green LED by the Motion Stop button is flashing and that all four corner LEDs are flashing red.
To disengage Stop Mode, press the Motion Stop button again; all LEDs should return to their original values.

When in Stop Mode, the Dingo will not drive.
The commands received while in Stop Mode are not buffered; Dingo will always act on the latest commands received.
This means that if the commands are stopped before the Motion Stop button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode, the Dingo will not move.
If the commands are continued, Dingo will move at the speed commanded once the Motion Stop button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode.

Ensure that the Motion Stop button is accessible at all times.
Avoid mounting payloads that extend over the rear of Dingo and would block access to the Motion Stop button.

Note that the Dingo MCU board does provide a breakout to allow an external motion-stop button/switch to be integrated by the end user, which could be used to engage/disengage Stop Mode.
See [Optional External Motion Stop](/docs/robots/dingo/integration_dingo#dingo-external-motion-stop) for details on adding an external motion-stop button/switch.

### Electrical System

Dingo is powered by batteries capable of delivering over 2000W for short durations.
This gives Dingo's motors their great performance; however, it is also enough power to cause severe bodily harm.
Always use caution when operating Dingo to avoid personal injury or property damage.
To ensure safety, please observe the following precautions:

- Do not tamper with the battery terminals or wiring.
- Do not tamper with the fuses, except to check and change the fuses.
- Always replace fuses with the same type and rating to ensure continued protection against risk of fires.
- Consult Clearpath Robotics support if you need to service the batteries.
- Do not lay tools or other objects on top of the batteries.
- Charge the battery only with the charger provided by Clearpath Robotics.
- Please dispose of the batteries properly or return them to Clearpath Robotics to do so.

### Lifting and Transport

- Ensure that Dingo's Stop Mode is engaged when transporting short distances and powered off when transporting longer distances.
- Do not push the robot at more than 0.5 m/s (1.6 ft/s) or damage to the motor controls may occur.

### Performance Considerations

Included in Dingo are native software checks and limits to protect the robot.
However, it is recommended to monitor the system's status during usage with the `/status` and `/diagnostics` topics.
These topics provides useful information regarding voltages, currents, temperatures and general health of the system.

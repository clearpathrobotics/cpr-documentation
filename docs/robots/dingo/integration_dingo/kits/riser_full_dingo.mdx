## Tools

## Installation

### Step 1

Remove four M5×0.8 screws from the Dingo's top plates where you will mount the riser.

:::note

We suggest you to remove the 3rd and 5th rows of screws from the front of the Dingo-D or Dingo-O.
You can choose different locations to suit your application, but this will require custom URDF software work.

:::

### Step 2

Insert the male threaded side of the shafts _(ID2)_ into the holes where you removed the screws in _Step 1_.

:::note 

Torque these shafts to 5 N·m if you are concerned about them loosening from high vibration applications.

:::

:::note

You may add a small amount of thread locker to these screws if you are concerned about them loosening from high vibration applications.

:::

### Step 3

Repeat this for the 3 remaining shafts.

### Step 4

Place the riser's plate on top of the shafts.
The plate is symmetrical, so there is not a front / back side.

### Step 5

Fasten the plate using 4 screws _(ID3)_

:::note 

Torque these screws to 5 N·m if you are concerned about them loosening from high vibration applications.

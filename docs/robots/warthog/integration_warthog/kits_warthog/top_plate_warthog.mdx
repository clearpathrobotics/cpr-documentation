The top plates for the Warthog include M5Ã—0.8 threaded holes that match the Clearpath PACS standard.

:::note

These top plates require [extrusion rails](../extrusion_rails_warthog) to be mounted on the Warthog.

:::note

You can install an [extrusion cross-bar](../extrusion_crossbar_warthog) under the top plates to add stiffness.

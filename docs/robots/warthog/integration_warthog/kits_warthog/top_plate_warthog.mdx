Place the Plate _(ID1)_ ontop of the Extrusion Rails and Crossbar. The Plate's countersink features should be facing up.

### Step 3

Install Screws _(ID3)_ into the Plate's holes; threading the Screws into the T-slop nuts from _Step 1_.

:::note

Torque these screws to 5 N·m if you are concerned about them loosening from high vibration applications.

:::

:::note

You may add a small amount of thread locker to these screws if you are concerned about them loosening from high vibration applications.

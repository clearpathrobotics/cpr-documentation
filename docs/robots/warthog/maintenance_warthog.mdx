## Battery and Charging

### Overview

Warthog contains a 48 V lead-acid battery pack, consisting of four 12 V lead-acid batteries, or a lithium battery pack, consisting of four 118 Ah 12.8 V batteries
connected in a 4S1P configuration with a single Battery Management System (BMS) control unit. Battery configuration may vary with each unit. In order to
maximize performance, it's important to ensure that the battery level across each set of lead-acid or lithium batteries is within 0.1-0.2 V.
If the batteries exceed this tolerance, it's advised to charge them to within tolerance before wiring these packs in parallel. The overall battery life
will vary depending upon the usage of the unit.

### Battery Management System

:::note

If your Warthog is equipped with a lead-acid battery pack, you can ignore this section on the Battery Management System.

:::

If your Warthog is equipped with a lithium battery pack, it is also equipped with a single Battery Management System (BMS) control unit.
The main function of the BMS is to:

- Protect the individual modules from being over charged or over discharged.
- Protect the modules from operating outside of their acceptable temperature range.
- Provide status information to higher level systems via a CAN interface.
- Provide independent system management without a higher level control system.
- Provide status, warning and error messages from each of the modules connected to the battery power system.
- Control the charging operation.
- Perform module to module balancing of the system, the battery module will control cell balancing within itself.

There is a main power contactor which is controlled by the BMS unit and is placed in such a way that it controls all power to the system.
Upon turning on the main disconnect switch:

The BMS powers up first and begins communicating with all of the battery modules in the system.
1. If they are all present and have no errors the BMS will close the main contactor and allow the Warthog to power up as normal,
  this process can take a few seconds before the main contactor closes.
    1. If all the modules are not present, the system State of Charge (SOC) is too low, or there are errors being reported by any of the
    modules in the system, the contactor will not close, and the system will not power up.
2. Similarly, if a user is in discharge mode (the Warthog is in use) and any errors are detected, or if the SOC falls to a cut off point,
  the contactor will open and remove power from the system to protect the modules.
    1. It is not good practice to run the SOC to 0%. This will decrease the life of the battery module. In general, keeping the SOC to a
    minimum of 30-50% can increase the lifetime of the batteries.
    2. As a note, the system SOC is identical to the module with the lowest SOC in the system, so if three modules are at 45% SOC, and
    one module is at 25%, then the SOC of the system is 25%, and the BMS will act accordingly cutting off power to protect the module with
    the lowest SOC. Cell balancing and proper charging techniques are important to maintaining good battery health.
3. The Warthog can be charged when the unit is powered and running, and can also be charged when the unit is not powered (main disconnect switch is open).
    1. The charger has been configured and wired in a way that the BMS is actually controlling the charger and can turn it off, and on, depending
    on the status of the charging cycle.
    2. Even though the unit can be charged while running, this process does not allow for proper cell balancing to occur. It will allow for bulk charge
    to occur to regain most of the charge in the system, however, repeatedly charging in this manner will allow each module to become out of balance with
    the other modules. If this process if followed long enough the SOC values for each module can vary by a substantial amount. The larger the variation,
    the longer it will take to fully balance the system. Therefore it is recommended (depending on use) that at least once every two to three weeks that
    **the system be completely charged while the main disconnect switch is in the off position.** Doing so will allow the BMS to go through an
    equalization phase where the charger is being turned on and off by the BMS to balance the voltages across each cell layer, in each module across the system.
    **This is a very important step in maintain battery health, and getting the maximum lifetime out of the battery system.**
    3. Refer to [BMS ROS Topics](#bms-ros-topics) to view the necessary topics through the ROS API.
4. To allow for this level of control there are three contactors in the system:
    1. The main contactor for discharge of the system.
    2. The charge contactor to connect to the output of the charger.
    3. The charge control relay to turn the charger outputs on and off and control the cell balancing or equalization phase of the charge cycle.

#### BMS ROS Topics   {#bms-ros-topics}

The table below shows topics that will be very useful in monitoring battery health, as discussed in the section above.

|  Topic                     | Purpose                                        |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `/bms/system_status`       | Primarily to view `state_of_charge` (%)        |
| `/bms/system_measurements` | Primarily to view `battery_system_current` (A) |

Note that the `battery_system_current` topic will be positive when the batteries are charging, indicating that
current is flowing into the batteries. The lights on the charger unit itself will also indicate when the device is
charging.

#### To Connect the Charger

1. Plug in the charger DC output cable (heavier gauge cable).
2. Plug in the charger auxiliary control cable.
3. Plug the charger into AC power (directly to the wall outlet, no extension cords).
4. This can be done with or without power on Warthog being on (however the note above applies, at least once every couple of weeks the charge
  process needs to be allowed to fully balance the system).

#### To Disconnect the Charger

1. Unplug the charger from AC power.
2. Unplug the charger auxiliary cable.
3. Unplug the charger DC output cable (heavier gauge cable).

### General Battery Safety and Maintenance

Always exercise caution and observe the following safety practices when connecting, disconnecting or handling batteries:

- Batteries are high voltage, high current.
- Batteries must be properly fastened down to ensure they do not move when the Warthog is in operation.
- Ensure that the batteries are evenly distributed throughout the Warthog to maximize stability.
- Battery levels on the unit should be checked on a regular basis.
  It's important to maintain the battery voltage at a suitable level for proper operation.
- When additional batteries are added to the system, it's important to connect the positive terminal first to the main power of the Warthog before connecting ground.
- When installing additional batteries, disconnect the ground on all batteries presently in the unit before connecting the positive terminal of the new batteries.

### Long-term Storage

When storing Warthog for long periods of time, it's important to properly maintain the batteries to fully maximize their life.
Consider the following procedure when placing Warthog in long-term storage:

- Fully charge Warthog, turn it off and put it into storage.
  Once a week, connect power to the charger and allow the charger to top up the battery for an hour or so.

Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Warthog's batteries.

## Tread Upgrade

If your unit came equipped with the tread upgrade, please keep the following considerations in mind:

- The tread drive units pull considerably more current to operate.
  It is advised to operate a tread Warthog at reduced speeds, either through ROS commands or by reducing the speed scale when operating with the Futaba controller.
- Due to the increased drive current, expect lower battery life than a wheeled Warthog.
  It is recommend to drive at reduced speeds to increase battery life.
- It is possible to trigger an over current error in the motor controller by increasing speed drastically shortly after resetting a stop condition.
  The system's body lights will seem as if the unit is ready to drive, however it will not respond to drive commands.
  To clear this state, simply cycle another stop condition, and ramp up speeds slower.

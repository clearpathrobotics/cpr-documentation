## Battery and Charging

### General

Warthog contains 48 V lead-acid or lithium-ion battery packs.
Each battery pack consists of four 12 V lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries.
Battery configuration may vary with each unit.
In order to maximize performance, it's important to ensure that the battery level across each set of lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries is within 0.1 - 0.2 V of each other.
If the battery packs exceed this tolerance, it's advised to charge them to within tolerance before wiring these packs in parallel.
The overall battery life will vary depending upon the usage of the unit.
Always exercise caution and observe the following safety practices when connecting, disconnecting or handling batteries:

- Batteries are high voltage, high current
- Battery packs must be properly fastened down to ensure they do not move when the Warthog is in operation.
- Ensure that the battery packs are evenly distributed throughout the Warthog to maximize stability.
- Battery levels on the unit should be checked on a regular basis.
  It's important to maintain the battery voltage at a suitable level for proper operation.
- When additional battery packs are added to the system, it's important to connect the positive terminal first to the main power of the Warthog before connecting ground.
- When installing additional battery packs, disconnect the ground on all battery packs presently in the unit before connecting the positive terminal of the new battery packs.

### Long-term Storage

When storing Warthog for long periods of time, it's important to properly maintain the batteries to fully maximize their life.
Consider one of the following two procedures when placing Warthog in long-term storage:

- Fully charge Warthog, turn it off and put it into storage.
  Once a week, connect power to the charger and allow the charger to top up the battery for an hour or so.
- Fully charge Warthog, turn it off and put it into storage, but leave the charger connected and powered the entire time Warthog is in storage.
  The charger will monitor the battery and will automatically charge it up as needed.

Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Warthog's battery pack.

## Tread Upgrade

If your unit came equipped with the tread upgrade, please keep the following considerations in mind:

- The tread drive units pull considerably more current to operate.
  It is advised to operate a tread Warthog at reduced speeds, either through ROS commands or by reducing the speed scale when operating with the Futaba controller.
- Due to the increased drive current, expect lower battery life than a wheeled Warthog.
  It is recommend to drive at reduced speeds to increase battery life.
- It is possible to trigger an over current error in the motor controller by increasing speed drastically shortly after resetting a stop condition.
  The system's body lights will seem as if the unit is ready to drive, however it will not respond to drive commands.
  To clear this state, simply cycle another stop condition, and ramp up speeds slower.

## Jackal Overview

### Introduction

Jackal is a rugged, lightweight, fast and easy-to-use unmanned ground robot for rapid prototyping
and research applications. These tutorials will assist you with setting up and operating your Jackal.
The tutorial topics are listed in the right column and presented in the suggested reading order.

For more information or to receive a quote, please [visit us online](http://clearpathrobotics.com/jackal).

:::note

These tutorials assume that you are comfortable working with [ROS](https://docs.ros.org/). We recommend starting with
[ROS2 tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html) if you are not familiar with ROS already.

:::

:::note

These tutorials specifically target Jackal robots running Ubuntu 20.04 with [ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html).

:::

[Jackal ROS Packages](#jackal-ros-packages) provides the references for the software packages and key ROS topics.

[Jackal Software Setup](#jackal-software-setup) outlines the steps for setting up the software on
your Jackal robot and optionally on a remote computer.

[Using Jackal](#using-jackal) describes how to simulate and drive your Jackal. [Simuation](#simulating-jackal)
is a great way for most users to learn more about their Jackal; understanding how to effectively operate Jackal
in simulation is valuable whether you are in the testing phase with software you intend to ultimately deploy on a
physical Jackal, or you do not have one and are simply exploring the platform's capabilities.
[Driving Jackal](#driving-jackal) covers how to teleoperate Jackal using the remote control, as well as safety
procedures for operating the physical robot. Anyone working with a physical robot should be familiar with this section.

<!-- [Jackal Tests](#testing-jackal) outlines how to validate that your physical Jackal is working correctly. -->

[Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) covers items that are only required in atypical situations.

## Jackal ROS Packages {#jackal-ros-packages}

Jackal fully supports ROS; all of the packages are available in [Jackal Github](https://github.com/jackal).
Notable packages include:

- Jackal Common packages: [Git repository](https://github.com/jackal/jackal/tree/foxy-devel)
- Jackal Robot packages: [Git repository](https://github.com/jackal/jackal_robot/tree/foxy-devel)
- Jackal Simulator packages: [Git repository](https://github.com/jackal/jackal_simulator/tree/foxy-devel)
- Jackal Desktop packages: [Git repository](https://github.com/jackal/jackal_desktop/tree/foxy-devel)

### Description Package

The [jackal_description](https://github.com/jackal/jackal/tree/foxy-devel/jackal_description) repository
provides a [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) model of Jackal.

Jackal's URDF model can be visualized in RViz and can be customized and extended through the use of several
environment variables. Once you have installed the desktop software in an upcoming tutorial,
you will be able to run:

```
ros2 launch jackal_viz view_model.launch.py
```

## Jackal Software Setup {#jackal-software-setup}

### Installing and Configuring Robot Software

#### Backing Up Robot Configuration

Upgrading your Clearpath Jackal to ROS2 Foxy from older ROS distributions (including ROS1) is supported;
however it's important to understand that each Jackal is different, having undergone customization to your
specifications.

Please take the time to understand what these modifications are and how to recreate them on your fresh install of
Ubuntu Focal + ROS2 Foxy.

##### Performing a Backup {#performing-a-backup}

<ComponentPerformingABackup />

#### Updating firmware

For ROS2 Foxy, Jackal uses new [microROS](https://micro.ros.org/) based
firmware.

Install the Jackal firmware package on the Jackal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-jackal-firmware
```

To update the firmware, place the Jackal MCU into bootloader mode by
switching the **PWR_MODE** switch from NORM to ALT, then
pressing the **M_RST** button.

Then, on the Jackal, run:

```bash
jackal_firmware_flash.sh
```

Wait for the firmware to be flashed.

Once the firmware has been flashed, place the Jackal MCU back into
normal mode by switching the **PWR_MODE** switch from ALT to
NORM. The robot will power off. Turn the robot back on by pressing the
power button.

#### Installing Ubuntu OS + ROS2

<ComponentRos1ToRos2UpgradePrep />

#### Installing Jackal Robot Software

:::note

The physical Jackal robot comes pre-configured with ROS and the necessary Jackal packages already installed;
therefore, you will only need to follow the instructions below if you are re-installing software on the Jackal.

:::

:::note

If you wish to install the Jackal packages on your computer (e.g. to
interface with the physical Jackal robot and/or to simulate Jackal), then
proceed with the following instructions below. A prequisite is to make
sure you have a working ROS2 Foxy installation set up on your computer.

:::

##### Installing from Debian Packages

:::note

Jackal Debian packages are not yet available. Please install from
source.

:::

The preferred way to install Jackal's packages is using precompiled
Debian packages. These packages are available for Ubuntu 20.04.

On the physical robot you need to install the `jackal_robot` package. In
terminal, run:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-jackal-robot
```

##### Installing from Source

Jackal packages are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jackal/),
and can be compiled and installed from source if desired:

1.  Install vcs:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-vcstool
    ```

2.  Create a workspace directory. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/jackal_ws/src
    ```

3.  Clone the Jackal repositories into your workspace directory. In
    terminal, run:

    ```bash
    cd ~/jackal_ws
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackal/jackal_robot/foxy-devel/dependencies.repos
    vcs import src < dependencies.repos
    ```

4.  Source the ROS2 Foxy installation. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    ```

5.  Install additional dependencies. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=$ROS_DISTRO -y
    ```

6.  Build the workspace. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    colcon build
    ```

7.  You can now source your workspace to make use of the packages you
    just built. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

##### Installing the microROS agent

The microROS agent is not currently released as a debian package, so we
must build it from source.

:::note

If you have built the Jackal packages from source, you can skip to step 7.
:::

1.  If you don't yet have a workspace directory, create one. In
    terminal, run:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/jackal_ws/src
    ```

2.  Clone the [micro_ros_setup]{.title-ref} repositories into your
    workspace directory. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    cd ~/jackal_ws/src
    git clone -b foxy https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup.git
    cd ..
    ```

3.  Source the ROS2 Foxy installation. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    ```

4.  Install additional dependencies. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && rosdep update
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y
    ```

5.  Build the workspace. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    colcon build
    ```

6.  You can now source your workspace to make use of the packages you
    just built. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

7.  Create and build the microROS agent. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_agent_ws.sh
    ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_agent.sh
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

##### Installing the systemd job

If you would like ROS2 to run on boot on the Jackal, first make sure
your `ROBOT_SETUP` environment variable is set to your workspace before
installing:

```bash
export ROBOT_SETUP=~/jackal_ws/install/setup.bash
```

Then install the job:

```bash
ros2 run jackal_robot install
```

##### Launching Jackal Software Manually

To run the ROS2 software in the terminal, first source the workspace:

```bash
source ~/jackal_ws/install/setup.bash
```

Then launch Jackal bringup. In a terminal, run:

```bash
ros2 launch jackal_robot bringup.launch.py
```

##### Testing Base Configuration

After installing the software, check that the system has started correct.

1. The Jackal Comms indicator <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-comms.png" width="20" /> should turn green.

2. Your Jackal should be accepting commands from your joystick (see next section).

#### Installing Jackal Desktop Software

:::note

If you wish to install the Jackal packages on your computer (e.g. to
interface with the physical Jackal robot and/or to simulate Jackal),
then proceed with the following instructions below. A prequisite is to
make sure you have a working ROS2 Foxy installation set up on your
computer.

:::

##### Add Clearpath Debian Package Repository

Before you can install the Jackal packages, you need to configure
Ubuntu's APT package manager to add Clearpath's package server:

1.  Install the authentication key for the
    packages.clearpathrobotics.com repository. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    wget https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

2.  Add the debian sources for the repository. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clearpath-latest.list'
    ```

3.  Update your computer's package cache. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

##### Installing from Debian Packages

The preferred way to install Jackal's packages is using precompiled
Debian packages. These packages are available for Ubuntu 20.04.

After your computer is configured to use Clearpath's debian package
repository, you can install the Jackal packages needed for this
tutorial. In a terminal, run:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-jackal-desktop ros-foxy-jackal-simulator
```

##### Installing from Source

Jackal packages are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jackal/),
and can be compiled and installed from source if desired:

1.  Create a workspace directory. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/jackal_ws/src
    ```

2.  Clone the Jackal repositories into your workspace directory. In
    terminal, run:

    ```bash
    cd ~/jackal_ws/src
    git clone -b foxy-devel https://github.com/jackal/jackal.git
    git clone -b foxy-devel https://github.com/jackal/jackal_desktop.git
    git clone -b foxy-devel https://github.com/jackal/jackal_simulator.git
    cd ..
    ```

3.  Source the ROS2 Foxy installation. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    ```

4.  Install additional dependencies. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=$ROS_DISTRO -y
    ```

5.  Build the workspace. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    colcon build
    ```

6.  You can now source your workspace to make use of the packages you
    just built. In a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

#### Pairing the Controller {#pairing-the-controller}

Joystick controllers are used for teleoperation; they allow you to
remotely drive the Jackal, whether it is a physical Jackal robot, or a
simulated Jackal. The following instructions below detail how to pair
different controllers to the Jackal's computer; however, these
instructions can also be used to pair these controllers to your own
computer.

##### PS4 Controller

:::note

If your Jackal comes with a PS4 controller, it will be paired already.
Simply turn on the Jackal and turn on the controller.
:::

<ComponentPs4ControllerPairing />

##### Logitech F710 Controller

:::caution

Logitech controllers are not considered safe, and usage should be experimental only. If your robot has bluetooth
capabilities, please switch to using a PS4 controller instead.

:::

To re-pair the Logitech F710 controller or pair a new Logitech F710
controller, plug the controller's USB dongle into the Jackal's computer
and turn on the controller. The controller pairs automatically.

### Setting up Jackal's Network Configuration {#jackal-networking}

Jackal is normally equipped with a combination Wi-Fi + Bluetooth module.
If this is your first unboxing, ensure that Jackal's wireless antennae are firmly screwed on to the chassis.
Some Jackal robots may only be equipped with a single antenna, depending on the exact model of computer installed in the robot.

#### First Connection

By default, Jackal's Wi-Fi is in client mode, looking for the wireless network at the Clearpath factory.

<ComponentWiredRobotConnection />

#### Changing the Default Password

<ComponentChangingDefaultPassword />

#### Wi-Fi Setup

<ComponentWifiRobotConnection />

### Remote ROS2 Connection {#remote-computer-software}

:::note

This step is optional.

## Using Jackal {#using-jackal}

### Simulating Jackal {#simulating-jackal}

Whether you actually have a Jackal robot or not, the Jackal simulator is a great way to get started with ROS2
robot development. In this tutorial, we will go through the basics of starting Gazebo and RViz and how to drive
your Jackal around.

#### Launching Gazebo

[Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home) is a common simulation tool used in ROS2. Jackal's model in
Gazebo includes reasonable approximations of its dynamics, including wheel slippage, skidding, and
inertia. To launch simulated Jackal in a simple example world, run the following command:

```
ros2 launch jackal_gazebo jackal_world.launch.py
```

You should see the following window appear, or something like it.

:::note

You can adjust the camera angle by clicking and dragging while holding CTRL, ALT,
or the Shift key.

:::

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/jackal_images/gazebo-jackal-race.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Simulated Jackal in the Race World</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

:::note

To stop the simulation, close the Gazebo window, and then CTRL-C out of the terminal
process.

:::

The window which you are looking at is the Gazebo Client. This window shows you the "true" state of the
simulated world which the robot exists in. It communicates on the backend with the Gazebo Server, which
is doing the heavy lifting of actually maintaining the simulated world. At the moment, you're running
both the client and server locally on your own machine, but some advanced users may choose to run heavy
duty simulations on separate hardware and connect to them over the network.

#### Launch RViz

The next tool we will encounter is [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz). Although superficially similar
in appearance to Gazebo, RViz has a very different purpose--- unlike
Gazebo, which shows the reality of the simulated world, RViz shows the
robot's _perception_ of its world, whether real or simulated. So while
Gazebo won't be used with your real Jackal, RViz is used with both.

:::note

If you are working with a simulated robot you should leave Gazebo
running and open a new terminal to launch RViz. If you installed the
Jackal simulation packages from source, make sure to run
`source install/setup.bash` in the workspace where the packages are
installed when opening the new terminal.
:::

You can using the following launch invocation to start RViz with a
pre-cooked configuration suitable for visualizing any standard Jackal
config:

```bash
ros2 launch jackal_viz view_robot.launch.py
```

You should see RViz appear:

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/jackal_images/jackal-urdf.png"
      width="600"
    />
    <figcaption>Jackal RViz</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

### Driving Jackal {#driving-jackal}

There are four ways to drive Jackal and each way will work on a physical Jackal robot as well as on a simulated Jackal.

1. Using the interactive remote controller in RViz. See [Simulating Jackal](#simulating-jackal).
2. Using autonomous navigation. This will be covered in a future tutorial.
3. Using the controller for teleoperation. See below.
4. Publishing ROS2 messages. See below.

:::warning

Jackal is capable of reaching high speeds.
Careless driving can cause harm to the operator, bystanders, the robot, or other property.
Always remain vigilant, ensure you have a clear line of sight to the robot, and operate the robot at safe speeds.
We strongly recommend driving in normal (slow) mode first, and only enabling turbo in large, open areas that are free of people and obstacles.

:::

#### Driving with Remote Controller

:::note

For instructions on controller pairing, [Pairing the Controller](#pairing-the-controller).

:::

<ComponentDrivingWithRemoteController />

##### Using Remote Control with Gazebo

:::note

You can also use a remote controller to drive your robot in Gazebo. To set up your computer for teleop
using the remote controller follow these steps:

1. Connect the controller to your computer.

2. Set the `JACKAL_JOY_DEVICE` environment variable to point to your game controller device
   Normally this will be `/dev/input/js0`.

3. Launch Gazebo as described in [Simulation](#simulating-jackal).

:::

#### Driving with ROS2 Messages

You can manually publish `geometry_msgs/Twist` ROS2 messages to either the
`/jackal_velocity_controller/cmd_vel_unstamped` or the `/cmd_vel` ROS2 topics to drive Jackal.

For example, in a terminal, run:

```
ros2 topic pub --once /jackal_velocity_controller/cmd_vel_unstamped geometry_msgs/msg/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.5, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}'
```

The command above makes Jackal drive forward momentarily at 0.5 m/s without any rotation. To
have Jackal move forward continually, remove `--once` and add `--rate 10` to the command above.

### Keeping Jackal Updated

For details on updating Jackal software or firmware, refer to [Software Maintenance](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/jackal/maintenance_jackal#software_maintenance).

## Testing Jackal {#testing-jackal}

Jackal robots come preinstalled with a set of test scripts as part of the `jackal_tests` ROS package, which can be run to verify robot functionality at the component and system levels.

If your Jackal does not have the `jackal_tests` ROS package installed already, you can manually install it by opening terminal and running:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-jackal-tests
```

### Running ROS Tests

The `ros_tests` script exposes a set of interactive tests to verify the functionality of core features.
These tests run at the ROS-level via ROS topics, and serve as a useful robot-level diagnostic tool for
identifying the root cause of problems, or at the very least, narrowing down on where the root cause(s) may be.

To run `ros_tests` on a Jackal robot, open terminal and run:

```
rosrun jackal_tests ros_tests
```

Upon running `ros_tests`, a list of available tests will be shown in a menu. From the menu, you can choose
individual tests to run, or simply choose the option to automatically run all the tests.

The details of each test are shown below.

- **Motion Stop Test**

  Checks that the robot's motion-stop is working properly.

  This test subscribes to the `/status` ROS topic and checks that when the motion-stop is manually engaged by
  the user, the motion-stop state is correctly reported on the `/status` ROS topic.

- **ADC Test**

  Checks that the robot's voltage and current values across its internal hardware components are within
  expected tolerances.

  This test subscribes to the `/status` ROS topic and checks that the voltage and current values across
  the internal hardware are within expected tolerances.

- **Rotate Test** (Optional test; only applies to Jackal's with an IMU)

  Rotates the robot counter clockwise 2 full revolutions and checks that the motors, IMU, and EKF odometry are working properly.

  This test:

  - Subscribes to the `/imu/data` ROS topic to receive angular velocity measurements from the IMU's Gyroscope.
    These measurements are converted into angular displacement estimations, and the robot will rotate until 2
    full revolutions are estimated.
  - Subscribes to the `/odometry/filtered` ROS topic to receive angular velocity estimations from the EKF
    odometry. These measurements are converted into angular displacement estimations, and are output as comparison
    to the angular displacement estimations from the IMU's Gyroscope.
  - Publishes to the `/cmd_vel` ROS topic to send drive commands to rotate the robot.
  - The user will be asked to verify that the robot rotates 2 full revolutions.

  :::note

  The **Rotate Test** rotates the robot using the IMU's Gyroscope data, which inherently will not be 100% accurate.
  Therefore, some undershoot/overshoot is to be expected.

  :::

- **Drive Test**

  Drives the robot forward 1 metre and checks that the motors, encoders, and encoder-fused odometry are working properly.

  This test:

  - Subscribes to the `/jackal_velocity_controller/odom` ROS topic to receive linear displacement estimations from the
    encoder-fused odometry. The robot will drive forward until 1 metre is estimated.
  - Subscribes to the `/joint_state` ROS topic to receive linear displacement measurements from individual the
    encoders. These measurements are output as comparison to the linear displacement estimations from the
    encoder-fused odometry.
  - Publishes to the `/cmd_vel` ROS topic to send drive commands to drive the robot.
  - The user will be asked to verify that the robot drives forward 1 metre.

  :::note

  The **Drive Test** drives the robot using the Odometry data, which inherently will not be 100% accurate.
  Therefore, some undershoot/overshoot is to be expected.

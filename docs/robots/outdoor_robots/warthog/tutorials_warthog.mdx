## Warthog Overview

### Introduction

Clearpath Robotics Warthog is a rugged, all-terrain unmanned ground vehicle. These tutorials will
assist you with setting up and operating your Warthog. The tutorial topics are listed in the right
column and presented in the suggested reading order.

For more information or to receive a quote, please [visit us online](http://clearpathrobotics.com/warthog).

:::note

These tutorials assume that you are comfortable working with ROS.
We recommend starting with our [ROS tutorial](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/noetic/ros/index.html) if you are not familiar with ROS already.

:::

:::note

These tutorials specifically target Warthog robots running Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic, as it is the standard OS environment for Warthog.
If instead you have an older Warthog robot running Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic, please follow [this tutorial](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html) to upgrade the robot OS environment to Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic.

:::

[Warthog ROS Packages](#warthog-ros-packages) provides the references for the software packages and key ROS topics.

[Warthog Software Setup](#warthog-software-setup) outlines the steps for setting up the software on your Warthog robot and optionally on a remote computer.

[Using Warthog](#using-warthog) describes how to simulate and drive your Warthog. [Simulation](#simulating-warthog) is a great way for most users to learn more about their Warthog;
understanding how to effectively operate Warthog in simulation is valuable whether you are in the testing phase with software you intend to ultimately deploy on a physical Warthog or you do not have one and are simply exploring the platform's capabilities.
[Driving Warthog](#driving-warthog) covers how to teleoperate Warthog using the remote control, as well as safety procedures for operating the physical robot.
Anyone working with a physical robot should be familiar with this section.

[Warthog Tests](#testing-warthog) outlines how to validate that your physical Warthog is working correctly.

[Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) covers items that are only required in atypical situations.

## Warthog ROS Packages {#warthog-ros-packages}

Warthog fully supports ROS; all of the packages are available in [Warthog Github](https://github.com/warthog-cpr).

### Description Package {#description-package}

The [warthog_description](https://github.com/warthog-cpr/warthog/tree/kinetic-devel/warthog_description) repository provides a [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) model of Warthog.

Warthog's URDF model can be visualized in RViz.
Once you have installed the desktop software in an upcoming tutorial, you will be able to run:

```
roslaunch warthog_viz view_model.launch
```

### Environment Variables {#environment-variables}

Warthog can be customized and extended through the use of several environment variables.
The details are in the [warthog_description](https://github.com/warthog-cpr/warthog/tree/kinetic-devel/warthog_description) repository.
Some of the most important ones are listed below.

| Variable                       | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                       |

### Configurations

As an alternative to individually specifying each accessory, some fixed configurations are provided in the package.
These can be specified using the `config` arg to `description.launch`, and are intended especially as a convenience for simulation launch.

| Config      | Description                                              |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |

| `base`      | Base Warthog, includes IMU and GPS                       |
| `bulkhead`  | Includes a mounting point for additional payload options |
| `empty`     | Includes no accessories at all                           |

### Key ROS Topics

You can view all topics that are active using `rostopic list`.
The most important topics are summarized in the table below.

## Warthog Software Setup {#warthog-software-setup}

### Backing Up Robot Configuration

Upgrading your Clearpath Warthog to ROS Noetic from older ROS distributions is a straightforward process;
however it's important to understand that each Warthog is different, having undergone customization to your specifications.
For more complete upgrade instructions see [this guide](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html).

Please take the time to understand what these modifications are, and how to recreate them on your fresh install of Ubuntu Focal/ROS Noetic.

#### Performing a Backup {#performing-a-backup}

<ComponentPerformingABackup />

### Installing and Configuring Robot Software

:::note

If you are upgrading your Warthog from an older version of ROS, please refer to our upgrade instructions [here](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/kinetic-to-melodic/index.html)
and [here](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html).

:::

#### Installing Warthog Software

:::note

The physical Warthog robot comes pre-configured with ROS and the necessary Warthog packages already installed;
therefore, you will only need to follow the instructions below if you are re-installing software on the Warthog.

:::

<ComponentInstallingRobotSoftware />

#### Testing Base Configuration

You can check that the service has started correctly by checking the logs:

```
sudo journalctl -u ros
```

Your Warthog should now be accepting commands from your joystick (see next section).
The service will automatically start each time you boot your Warthog's computer.

### Setting up Warthog's Network Configuration {#warthog-networking}

Warthog is normally equipped with a combination Wi-Fi + Bluetooth module.
If this is your first unboxing, ensure that Warthog's wireless antennae are firmly screwed onto the chassis.

#### First Connection

By default, Warthog's Wi-Fi is in client mode, looking for the wireless network at the Clearpath factory.

## Using Warthog {#using-warthog}

### Simulating Warthog {#simulating-warthog}

Whether you actually have a Warthog robot or not, the Warthog simulator is a great way to get started with ROS robot development.
In this tutorial, we will go through the basics of starting Gazebo and RViz and how to drive your Warthog around.

#### Installation

To get started with the Warthog simulation, make sure you have a [working ROS installation](#remote-computer-software) set up on your Ubuntu desktop, and install the Warthog-specific metapackages for desktop and simulation:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-warthog-simulator ros-noetic-warthog-desktop
```

#### Launching Gazebo

[Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home) is the most common simulation tool used in ROS. Warthog's model in Gazebo include reasonable approximations of its dynamics, including wheel slippage, skidding, and inertia.
To launch simulated Warthog in a simple example world, run the following command:

```
roslaunch warthog_gazebo warthog_world.launch
```

You should see the following window appear, or something like it.
You will see a base Warthog spawned with no additional sensors.
You can adjust the camera angle by clicking and dragging while holding CTRL, ALT, or the Shift key.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/warthog_images/warthog_gazebo.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Simulated Warthog in Example World</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The window which you are looking at is the Gazebo Client.
This window shows you the "true" state of the simulated world which the robot exists in.
It communicates on the backend with the Gazebo Server, which is doing the heavy lifting of actually maintaining the simulated world.
At the moment, you are running both the client and server locally on your own machine, but some advanced users may choose to run heavy duty simulations on separate hardware and connect to them over the network.

:::note

When simulating, you must leave Gazebo running.
Closing Gazebo will prevent other tools, such as RViz (see below) from working correctly.

:::

:::note

See also [Additional Simulation Worlds](#additional-sim).

:::

### Interfacing with Warthog

Both simulated and real Warthog robots expose the same ROS interface and can be interacted with in the same way.

:::note

Please make sure that the desktop packages for Warthog are installed:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-warthog-desktop
```

:::

#### Launching RViz

The next tool we will encounter is [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/RViz).
Although superficially similar in appearance to Gazebo, RViz has a very different purpose. Unlike Gazebo, which shows the reality of the simulated world, RViz shows the robot's _perception_ of its world, whether real or simulated.
So while Gazebo won't be used with your real Warthog, RViz is used with both.

You can use the following launch invocation to start RViz with a predefined configuration suitable for visualizing any standard Warthog config.

```
roslaunch warthog_viz view_robot.launch
```

You should see RViz appear.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/warthog_images/warthog_RViz.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Warthog RViz</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The RViz display only shows what the robot knows about its world, which presently, is nothing.
Because the robot doesn't yet know about the barriers which exist in its Gazebo world, they are not shown here.

#### Driving with Interactive Controller

RViz will also show Warthog's interactive markers around your Warthog's model.
These will appear as a blue ring and red arrows.
Depending on your robot, there will also be green arrows.
If you don't see them in your RViz display, select the Interact tool from the top toolbar and they should appear.

Drag the red arrows in RViz to move in the linear X direction, and the blue circle to move in the angular Z direction.
If your robot supports lateral/sideways movement, you can drag the green arrows to move in the linear Y direction.
RViz shows you Warthog moving relative to its odometric frame, but it is also moving relative to the simulated world supplied by Gazebo.
If you click over to the Gazebo window, you will see Warthog moving within its simulated world.
Or, if you drive real Warthog using this method, it will have moved in the real world.

#### Control

There are three ways to send your Warthog control commands:

1.  Using the provided Fubata controller.
    Refer to the [User Manual](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/warthog/user_manual_warthog/#controller) details on how to use the controller.

2.  Using the RViz instance above.
    If you select the Interact option in the top toolbar, an interactive marker will appear around the Warthog and can be used to control speed.

3.  The [rqt_robot_steering plugin](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_robot_steering).
    Run the `rqt` command, and select **Plugins→Robot Tools→Robot Steering** from the top menu.

Warthog uses [twist_mux](http://wiki.ros.org/twist_mux) to mix separate [geometry_msgs\Twist](http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html) control channels into the `warthog_velocity_controller/cmd_vel` topic.

Additional velocity channels can be defined in [twist_mux.yaml](https://github.com/warthog-cpr/warthog/blob/kinetic-devel/warthog_control/config/twist_mux.yaml), or can be piped into the lowest-priority `cmd_vel` topic.

#### Odometry

Warthog publishes odometry information on the `odometry/filtered` topic, as [nav_msgs/Odometry messages](http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html).
These are generated by [ekf_localization_node](http://wiki.ros.org/robot_localization), which processes data from several sensor sources using an Extended Kalman filter (EKF).
This includes data from the wheel encoders and IMU (if available).

#### Diagnostics

:::note

Diagnostics are only applicable to real Warthog robots, not simulated ones.

:::

Warthog provides hardware and software system [diagnostics](http://wiki.ros.org/diagnostics) on the ROS standard `/diagnostics` topic.
The best way to view these messages is using the [rqt_runtime_monitor](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_runtime_monitor) plugin.
Run the `rqt` command, and select **Plugins→Robot Tools→Runtime Monitor** from the top menu.

The same information is also published as a [warthog_msgs\Status](https://docs.ros.org/en/api/warthog_msgs/html/msg/Status.html) message on the `Status` topic.

From your desktop, you can also launch the standard RQT Robot Monitor. This will report the diagnostic output
from Warthog's self-monitoring capabilities, as shown in the figure below.

```
rosrun rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor
```

      width="600"
    />
    <figcaption>Robot Monitor</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

### Driving Warthog {#driving-warthog}

There are three ways to drive Warthog and each way will work on a physical Warthog robot as well as on a simulated Warthog.

1.  Using the interactive remote controller in RViz. See [Simulating Warthog](#simulating-warthog).
2.  Using the controller for teleoperation. See below.
3.  Publishing ROS messages. See below.

:::warning

Warthog is capable of reaching high speeds.
Careless driving can cause harm to the operator, bystanders, the robot, or other property.
Always remain vigilant, ensure you have a clear line of sight to the robot, and operate the robot at safe speeds.
The maximum speed is controllable through a dial on the Fubata controller; we strongly recommend setting the maximum
speed to a low value for initial driving tests and only setting maximum speed to a high value in open areas that are
free of people and obstacles.

:::

:::caution Pinch Points

Refer to [Pinch Points](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/warthog/user_manual_warthog#warthog-pinch-points) for
pinch points on the Warthog that should be avoided during operation.

:::

#### Driving with Remote Controller

Warthog uses a standard Futaba remote control radio transmitter. To operate the remote, first power it on by sliding
the power switch to the ON position, as indicated in the image below.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/warthog_images/robot_warthog_10.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Fubata Controller</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To drive the Warthog, the spring-loaded deadman switch in the upper-right corner must be held down. Releasing this switch will prevent the robot from moving.

The lever on the left controls the robot's speed and the lever on the right controls the robot's rotation.

#### Driving with ROS Messages

You can manually publish `geometry_msgs/Twist` ROS messages to either the `/warthog_velocity_controller/cmd_vel` or the `/cmd_vel` ROS topics to drive Warthog.

For example, in terminal, run:

```

```

The command above makes Warthog drive forward momentarily at 0.5 m/s without any rotation.

### Extending Warthog Startup

Now that you've had Warthog for a while, you may be interested in how to extend it, perhaps add some more payloads, or augment the URDF.

#### Startup Launch Context

When ROS packages are grouped together in a directory and then built as one, the result is referred to as a workspace.
Each workspace generates a `setup.bash` file which the user may source in order to correctly set up important environment variables such as `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, and `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

The standard system-wide setup file is in `/opt`:

```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```

When you run this command, you'll have access to `rosrun`, `roslaunch`, and all the other tools and packages installed on your system from Debian packages.

However, sometimes you want to add additional system-specific environment variables, or perhaps packages built from source.
For this reason, Clearpath platforms use a wrapper setup file, located in `/etc/ros`:

```
source /etc/ros/setup.bash
```

This is the setup file which gets sourced by Warthog's background launch job, and in the default configuration, it is also sourced on your login session.
For this reason it can be considered the "global" setup file for Warthog's ROS installation.

This file sets some environment variables and then sources a chosen ROS workspace, so it is one of your primary modification points for altering how Warthog launches.

#### Launch Files

The second major modification point is the `/etc/ros/noetic/ros.d` directory.
This location contains the launch files associated with the `ros` background job.
If you add launch files here, they will be launched with Warthog's startup.

However, it's important to note that in the default configuration, any launch files you add may only reference ROS software installed in `/opt/ros/noetic`.
If you want to launch something from workspace in the home directory, you must change `/etc/ros/setup.bash` to source that workspace's setup file rather than the one from `/opt`.

#### Adding URDF

There are two possible approaches to augmenting Warthog's URDF.
The first is that you may simply set the `Warthog_URDF_EXTRAS` environment variable in `/etc/ros/setup.bash`.
By default, it points to an empty dummy file, but you can point it to a file of additional links and joints which you would like mixed into Warthog's URDF (via xacro) at runtime.

The second, more sophisticated way to modify the URDF is to create a _new_ package for your own robot, and build your own URDF which wraps the one provided by
[warthog_description](https://github.com/warthog-cpr/warthog/tree/kinetic-devel/warthog_description).

### Keeping Warthog Updated

For details on updating Warthog software or firmware, refer to [Software Maintenance](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/warthog/maintenance_warthog#software_maintenance).

## Warthog Tests {#testing-warthog}

Warthog robots come preinstalled with a set of test scripts as part of the `warthog_tests` ROS package, which can be run to verify robot functionality at the component and system levels.

If your Warthog does not have the `warthog_tests` ROS package installed already, you can manually install it by opening terminal and running:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-warthog-tests
```

### ROS Tests

The `ros_tests` script exposes a set of interactive tests to verify the functionality of core features.
These tests run at the ROS-level via ROS topics, and serve as a useful robot-level diagnostic tool for identifying the root cause of problems, or at the very least, narrowing down on where the root cause(s) may be.

#### Running ROS Tests

To run `ros_tests` on a Warthog robot, open terminal and run:

```
rosrun warthog_tests ros_tests
```

Upon running `ros_tests`, a list of available tests will be shown in a menu.
From the menu, you can choose individual tests to run, or simply choose the option to automatically run all the tests.

The details of each test are shown below.

- **Lighting Test**

  The **Lighting Test** checks that the robot's lights are working properly.

  This test turns the lights off, red, green, and blue (in order) by publishing lighting commands to the `/cmd_lights` ROS topic.
  The user will be asked to verify that the lights change to the expected colours.

- **Motion Stop Test**

  The **Motion Stop Test** checks that the robot's motion-stop is working properly.

  This test subscribes to the `/mcu/status` ROS topic and checks that when the motion-stop is manually engaged by the user, the motion-stop state is correctly reported on the `/mcu/status` ROS topic.
  The user will be asked to verify that the lights flash red while the motion-stop is engaged.

- **ADC Test**

  The **ADC Test** checks that the robot's voltage and current values across its internal hardware components are within expected tolerances.

  This test subscribes to the `/mcu/status` ROS topic and checks that the voltage and current values across the internal hardware are within expected tolerances.

- **Rotate Test**

  The **Rotate Test** rotates the robot counter clockwise 2 full revolutions and checks that the motors, IMU, and EKF odometry are working properly.

  This test:

  - Subscribes to the `/imu/data` ROS topic to receive angular velocity measurements from the IMU's Gyroscope.
    These measurements are converted into angular displacement estimations, and the robot will rotate until 2 full revolutions are estimated.
  - Subscribes to the `/odometry/filtered` ROS topic to receive angular velocity estimations from the EKF odometry.
    These measurements are converted into angular displacement estimations, and are output as comparison to the angular displacement estimations from the IMU's Gyroscope.
  - Publishes to the `/cmd_vel` ROS topic to send drive commands to rotate the robot.
  - The user will be asked to verify that the robot rotates 2 full revolutions.

  :::note

  The **Rotate Test** rotates the robot using the IMU's Gyroscope data, which inherently will not be 100% accurate.
  Therefore, some undershoot/overshoot is to be expected.

  :::

- **Drive Test**

  The **Drive Test** drives the robot forward 1 metre and checks that the motors, encoders, and encoder-fused odometry are working properly.

  This test:

  - Subscribes to the `/warthog_velocity_controller/odom` ROS topic to receive linear displacement estimations from the encoder-fused odometry.
    The robot will drive forward until 1 metre is estimated.
  - Subscribes to the `/joint_state` ROS topic to receive linear displacement measurements from individual the encoders.
    These measurements are output as comparison to the linear displacement estimations from the encoder-fused odometry.
  - Publishes to the `/cmd_vel` ROS topic to send drive commands to drive the robot.
  - The user will be asked to verify that the robot drives forward 1 metre.

  :::note

  The **Drive Test** drives the robot using the Odometry data, which inherently will not be 100% accurate.
  Therefore, some undershoot/overshoot is to be expected.

  :::

### CAN Bus Test

The `check_can_bus_interface` script checks that communication between the motors, encoders, robot's MCU, and robot's computer are working properly over the CAN bus interface.

This script verifies that the `can0` interface is detected and activated, then proceeds to check the output of `candump` to verify that good CAN packets are being transmitted.

#### Running CAN Bus Test

To run the `check_can_bus_interface` script on a Warthog robot, open terminal and run:

```
rosrun warthog_tests check_can_bus_interface
```

## Advanced Topics

### Configuring the Network Bridge

<ComponentConfiguringNetworkBridge />

### Additional Simulation Worlds {#additional-sim}

In addtion to the default `warthog_world.launch` file, `warthog_gazebo` contains
three additional launch files:

- `empty_world.launch`, which spawns Warthog in a featureless, infinite plane;
- `warthog_race.launch`, which spawns a world with lots of linear barriers; and
- `spawn_warthog.launch`, which is intended to be included in any custom world to add a Warthog simulation to it.

To add a Warthog to any of your own worlds, simply include the `spawn_warthog.launch` file in your own world's launch:

```markup
<include file="$(find warthog_gazebo)/launch/spawn_warthog.launch">
  <!-- Optionally configure the spawn position -->
  <arg name="x" value="$(arg x)"/>
  <arg name="y" value="$(arg y)"/>
  <arg name="z" value="$(arg z)"/>
  <arg name="yaw" value="$(arg yaw)"/>
</include>
```

Finally, Clearpath provides an additional suite of simulation environments that can be downloaded separately and used with Warthog, as described below.

#### Clearpath Gazebo Worlds

The Clearpath Gazebo Worlds collection contains 4 different simulation worlds, representative of different environments our robots are designed to operate in:

- Inspection World: a hilly outdoor world with water and a cave
- Agriculture World: a flat outdoor world with a barn, fences, and solar farm
- Office World: a flat indoor world with enclosed rooms and furniture
- Construction World: office world, under construction with small piles of debris and partial walls

Warthog is supported in Inspection and Agriculture Worlds.

#### Installation

To download the Clearpath Gazebo Worlds, clone the repository from github into the same workspace as your Warthog:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_gazebo.git
```

Before you can build the package, make sure to install dependencies.
Because Clearpath Gazebo Worlds depends on all of our robot's simulation packages, and some of these are currently only
available as source code, installing dependencies with `rosdep install --from-paths [...]` will likely fail.

To simulate Warthog in the Office and Construction worlds the only additional dependency is the `gazebo_ros` package.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can build the package:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

#### Running the Inspection Simulation

Inspection World is a hilly, outdoor world that includes a water feature, bridge, pipeline, small cave/mine,
and a small solar farm. It is intended to simulate a variety of missions, including pipeline inspection,
cave/underground navigation, and localization on non-planar terrain.

To launch the inspection simulation, run

```
roslaunch cpr_inspection_gazebo inspection_world.launch platform:=warthog
```

To customize Warthog's payload, for example to add additional sensors, see
[Customizing Warthog's Payload](#customize-payload).

Once the simulation is running you can use RViz and other tools as described in
[Simulating Warthog](#simulating-warthog) to control and monitor the robot.
For example, below we can see Warthog exploring the cave:

<center>
  <figure>

  </figure>
</center>

and Warthog's perception of the inside of the cave as a 3D pointcloud in RViz:

  </figure>
</center>

#### Running the Agriculture Simulation

Agriculture World is a flat, mixed indoor/outdoor world that include a large barn, open fields surrounded by fences,
and a large solar farm. It is intended to simulate missions such as solar panel inspection and area coverage.

  </figure>
</center>

To launch the agriculture simulation, run

```
roslaunch cpr_agriculture_gazebo agriculture_world.launch platform:=warthog
```

To customize Warthog's payload, for example to add additional sensors, see
[Customizing Warthog's Payload](#customize-payload).

Once the simulation is running you can use RViz and other tools as described in
[Simulating Warthog](#simulating-warthog) to control and monitor the robot.

#### Customizing Warthog's Payload {#customize-payload}

To customize Warthog's payload you must use the environment variables described in
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables).

You can add additional sensors by creating a customized URDF and setting the `WARTHOG_URDF_EXTRAS` environment
variable to point to it.

For example, let's suppose you want to equip Warthog with an Intel RealSense D435 camera. First, install the `realsense2_camera`
and `realsense2_description` packages, along with the gazebo plugins:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-realsense2-camera ros-$ROS_DISTRO-realsense2-description ros-$ROS_DISTRO-gazebo-plugins
```

Then create your customized URDF file, for example `$HOME/Desktop/realsense.urdf.xacro`. Put the following in it:

```markup
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot xmlns:xacro="http://ros.org/wiki/xacro">

  <link name="front_realsense" />

  <!--
    The gazebo plugin aligns the depth data with the Z axis, with X=left and Y=up
    ROS expects the depth data along the X axis, with Y=left and Z=up
    This link only exists to give the gazebo plugin the correctly-oriented frame
  -->
  <link name="front_realsense_gazebo" />
  <joint name="front_realsense_gazebo_joint" type="fixed">

  </joint>

  </joint>
</robot>
```

This file defines the additional links for adding a RealSense camera to the robot, as well as configuring the `openni_kinect`
plugin for Gazebo to simulate data from a depth camera. The camera itself will be connected to the Warthog's `top_chassis_link`
link, offset 62.5 cm towards the front of the robot.

Now, set the `WARTHOG_URDF_EXTRAS` environment variable and try viewing the Warthog model:

```
export WARTHOG_URDF_EXTRAS=$HOME/Desktop/realsense.urdf.xacro
roslaunch warthog_viz view_model.launch
```

You should see the Warthog model in RViz, with the RealSense camera mounted to it:

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/warthog_images/warthog_realsense.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Warthog with a RealSense D435 connected to it</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To launch the customized Warthog in any of the new simulation environments, similarly run:

```
export WARTHOG_URDF_EXTRAS=$HOME/Desktop/realsense.urdf.xacro
roslaunch cpr_inspection_gazebo inspection_world.launch platform:=warthog
```

You should see Warthog spawn in the office world with the RealSense camera:

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/warthog_images/warthog_inspection_cave.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Warthog in Inspection cave</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

You can view the sensor data from the RealSense camera by running

```
roslaunch warthog_viz view_robot.launch
```

and adding the camera & pointcloud from the `/realsense/color/image_raw` and `/realsense/depth/color/points` topics:

<center>

## Husky Overview

### Introduction

Husky is a rugged, outdoor-ready unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), suitable for research and rapid prototyping applications.
These tutorials will assist you with setting up and operating your Husky. The tutorial topics are listed in
the right column and presented in the suggested reading order.

For more information or to receive a quote, please [visit us online](http://clearpathrobotics.com/husky).

:::note

These tutorials assume that you are comfortable working with ROS. We recommend starting with our
[ROS tutorial](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/noetic/ros/index.html) if you are not familiar with ROS already.

:::

:::note

These tutorials specifically target Husky robots running Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic, as it is the standard
OS environment for Husky. If instead you have an older Husky robot running Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic,
please follow [this tutorial](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html)
to upgrade the robot OS environment to Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic.

:::

[Husky ROS Packages](#husky-ros-packages) provides the references for the software packages and key ROS topics.

[Husky Software Setup](#husky-software-setup) outlines the steps for setting up the software on
your Husky robot and optionally on a remote computer.

[Using Husky](#using-husky) describes how to simulate and drive your Husky. [Simuation](#simulating-husky)
is a great way for most users to learn more about their Husky; understanding how to effectively operate Husky
in simulation is valuable whether you are in the testing phase with software you intend to ultimately deploy on a
physical Husky, or you do not have one and are simply exploring the platform's capabilities.
[Driving Husky](#driving-husky) covers how to teleoperate Husky using the remote control, as well as safety
procedures for operating the physical robot. Anyone working with a physical robot should be familiar with this section.

[Navigating Husky](#navigating-husky) is a follow-on to what is learned in the [Simuation](#simulating-husky)
tutorial, as navigation and map-making may be run in the simulated environment. However, this content is applicable
to both the simulator and the real platform, if your Husky is equipped with a laser scanner.

[Husky Tests](#testing-husky) outlines how to validate that your physical Husky is working correctly.

[Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) covers items that are only required in atypical situations.

## Husky ROS Packages {#husky-ros-packages}

Husky fully supports ROS; all of the packages are available in [Husky Github](https://github.com/husky).

### Description Package

The [husky_description](https://github.com/husky/husky/tree/noetic-devel/husky_description) repository
provides a [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) model of Husky.

Husky's URDF model can be visualized in RViz. Once you have installed the desktop software in an upcoming tutorial,
you will be able to run:

```
roslaunch husky_viz view_model.launch
```

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/husky_view_model.png"
      width="600"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky model</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Husky can be customized and extended through the use of several environment variables. These are summarized in the
[README](https://github.com/husky/husky/blob/noetic-devel/husky_description/README.md) file.

### Key ROS Nodes and Topics

#### Nodes

You can use `rosnode list` to see all the nodes running by default on a Husky computer.
The most important nodes are summarized in the following table.

| Node                     | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/husky_node`            | Provides control and communication between the Husky platform and ROS. Accepts velocity commands and provides system feedback on `/status` |
| `/robot_state_publisher` | Subscribes to `/joint_states` and publishes the robot's state to `/tf`                                                                     |
| `/bluetooth_teleop`      | Publishes velocity commands from a joystick to `/twist_mux`                                                                                |
| `/twist_mux`             | Takes in multiple sources of velocity commands, and prioritizes what actually gets sent to the controller                                  |
| `/ekf_localization`      | Part of the robot localization package, more information regarding this package can be found at <http://wiki.ros.org/robot_localization>   |

#### Topics

You can view all topics that are active using `rostopic list`.
The most important topics are summarized in the two tables below.

##### General Topics

| Topic                   | Message type             | Description                                                                                                                        |

## Husky Software Setup {#husky-software-setup}

### Backing Up Robot Configuration

Upgrading your Clearpath Husky to ROS Noetic from older ROS distributions is a straightforward process;
however it's important to understand that each Husky is different, having undergone customization to your
specifications. For more complete upgrade instructions see
[this guide](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html).

Please take the time to understand what these modifications are, and how to recreate them on your fresh install of
Ubuntu Focal/ROS Noetic.

#### Performing a Backup {#performing-a-backup}

<ComponentPerformingABackup />

### Installing and Configuring Robot Software

:::note

If you are upgrading your Husky from an older version of ROS, please refer to
our upgrade instructions [here](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/kinetic-to-melodic/index.html)
and [here](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html).

:::

#### Installing Husky Software

:::note

The physical Husky robot comes pre-configured with ROS and the necessary Husky packages already installed;
therefore, you will only need to follow the instructions below if you are re-installing software on the Husky.

:::

<ComponentInstallingRobotSoftware />

#### Testing Base Configuration

1. To test your configuration, start the background service with the following command:

   ```
   sudo systemctl start ros
   ```

2. The `COMM` light on your Husky should go from red to green. You can check that the service has started correctly
   by checking the logs:

   ```
   sudo journalctl -u ros
   ```

3. Your Husky should now be accepting commands from your joystick (see next section).
   The service will automatically start each time you boot your Husky's computer.

#### Pairing the Controller {#pairing-the-controller}

##### PS4 Controller

<ComponentPs4ControllerPairing />

##### Logitech F710 Controller

:::caution

Logitech controllers are not considered safe, and usage should be experimental only. If your robot has bluetooth capabilities, please switch to using a PS4 controller instead.

:::

Some Husky robots ship with a Logitech F710 controller instead of a PS4 controller. Pairing these controllers
is very easy: simply plug the USB dongle into one of robot's USB ports and turn the controller on.

By default Husky will use the PS4 controller for teleoperation and ignore the F710. To enable the F710 to control
the robot, run `sudo nano /etc/ros/setup.bash` and add the following line to the middle of the file, under the six
`#` characters:

```
######
export HUSKY_LOGITECH=1
```

Save the file and press CTRL + X to save and quit nano. Then restart ROS by running `sudo systemctl restart ros` or rebooting the robot.
When ROS restarts it will now use the Logitech controller as its teleoperation input device.

### Setting up Husky's Network Configuration {#husky-networking}

Husky is normally equipped with a combination Wi-Fi + Bluetooth module.
If this is your first unboxing, ensure that Husky's wireless antennae are firmly screwed on to the chassis.
Some Husky robots may only be equipped with a single antenna, depending on the exact model of PC installed in the robot.

#### First Connection

By default, Husky's Wi-Fi is in client mode, looking for the wireless network at the Clearpath factory.

<ComponentWiredRobotConnection />

#### Changing the Default Password

<ComponentChangingDefaultPassword />

#### Wi-Fi Setup

<ComponentWifiRobotConnection />

### Installing Remote Computer Software {#remote-computer-software}

:::note

This step is optional.

:::

<ComponentInstallingRemoteComputerSoftware />

### Customizing Husky Configuration

:::note

These tutorials assume that you are familiar with ROS and the catkin build system.
Please familiarize yourself using the [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) and
[catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials) tutorials.

:::

If upgrading from a prior ROS release, you should now re-examine your backed-up files from
[Performing a Backup](#performing-a-backup) to determine if there's any customizations that
need to be configured on your platform.

#### Environment Variables {#environment-variables}

Husky can be customized and extended through the use of several environment variables. These are summarized in the
[README](https://github.com/husky/husky/blob/noetic-devel/husky_description/README.md) file.

#### Adding a Source Workspace

## Using Husky {#using-husky}

### Simulating Husky {#simulating-husky}

Whether you actually have a Husky robot or not, the Husky simulator is a great way to get started with ROS
robot development. In this tutorial, we will go through the basics of starting Gazebo and RViz and how to drive
your Husky around.

#### Installation

To get started with the Husky simulation, make sure you have a [working ROS installation](#remote-computer-software)
set up on your Ubuntu desktop, and install the Husky-specific metapackages for desktop and simulation:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-simulator ros-noetic-husky-desktop
```

#### Launching Gazebo

[Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home) is the most common simulation tool used in ROS. Husky's model in
Gazebo include reasonable approximations of its dynamics, including wheel slippage, skidding, and
inertia. To launch simulated Husky in a simple example world, run the following command:

```
roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
```

You should see the following window appear, or something like it.

:::note

You can adjust the camera angle by clicking and dragging while holding CTRL, ALT,
or the Shift key.

:::

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/husky_gazebo_playpen.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Simulated Husky in the Play Pen</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

:::note

To stop the simulation, close the Gazebo window, and then CTRL-C out of the terminal
process.

:::

The window which you are looking at is the Gazebo Client. This window shows you the "true" state of the
simulated world which the robot exists in. It communicates on the backend with the Gazebo Server, which
is doing the heavy lifting of actually maintaining the simulated world. At the moment, you're running
both the client and server locally on your own machine, but some advanced users may choose to run heavy
duty simulations on separate hardware and connect to them over the network.

Note that like Husky itself, Husky can be customized for simulations. For example, to add a front laser,
stop the previous simulation, enable the appropriate environment variable (see
[here](https://github.com/husky/husky/blob/noetic-devel/husky_description/README.md) for options)
and re-launch the simulation.

```
export HUSKY_LMS1XX_ENABLED='1'
roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
```

You should now see the simulator running with the simulated SICK LMS-111 laser present:

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/husky_gazebo_playpen_lms111.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Simulated Husky in the Race World with SICK LMS-111</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Gazebo not only simulates the physical presence of the laser scanner, it also provides simulated data
which reflects the robot's surroundings in its simulated world. We will visualize the simulated laser
scanner data shortly.

:::note

See also [Additional Simulation Worlds](#additional-sim).

:::

##### Customizing Husky's Payload {#husky-custom-payload}

To customize Husky's payload you must use the environment variables described in [here](#environment-variables).
For example, to equip Husky with a Sick LMS-1xx lidar, as pictured in several of the images above, run

```
export HUSKY_LMS1XX_ENABLED=1
```

before launching the simulation world.

You can also add additional sensors by creating a customized URDF and setting the `HUSKY_URDF_EXTRAS` environment
variable to point to it.

For example, let's suppose you want to equip Husky with an Intel RealSense D435 camera.
First, install the `realsense2_camera` and `realsense2_description` packages, along with the gazebo plugins:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-realsense2-camera ros-$ROS_DISTRO-realsense2-description ros-$ROS_DISTRO-gazebo-plugins
```

Then create your customized URDF file, for example `$HOME/Desktop/realsense.urdf.xacro`. Put the following in it:

```markup
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot xmlns:xacro="http://ros.org/wiki/xacro">

  <link name="front_realsense" />

  <!--
    The gazebo plugin aligns the depth data with the Z axis, with X=left and Y=up
    ROS expects the depth data along the X axis, with Y=left and Z=up
    This link only exists to give the gazebo plugin the correctly-oriented frame

</robot>
```

This file defines the additional links for adding a RealSense camera to the robot, as well as
configuring the `openni_kinect` plugin for Gazebo to simulate data from a depth camera. The
camera itself will be connected to the Husky's `top_plate_front_link` link. This places the
camera at the very front edge of the robot's top cover-plate.

Now, set the `HUSKY_URDF_EXTRAS` environment variable and try viewing the Husky model:

```
export HUSKY_URDF_EXTRAS=$HOME/Desktop/realsense.urdf.xacro
roslaunch husky_viz view_model.launch
```

You should see the Husky model in RViz, with the RealSense camera mounted to it:

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/husky_realsense.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky with a RealSense D435 connected to it</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To launch the customized Husky in any of the new simulation environments, similarly run:

```
export HUSKY_URDF_EXTRAS=$HOME/Desktop/realsense.urdf.xacro
roslaunch cpr_office_gazebo office_world.launch platform:=husky
```

You should see Husky spawn in the office world with the RealSense camera:

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/husky_office_realsense.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky with a RealSense D435 connected to it in Office World</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

You can view the sensor data from the RealSense camera by running

```
roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
```

and adding the camera and pointcloud from the `/realsense/color/image_raw` and
`/realsense/depth/color/points` topics:

      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/husky_rviz_realsense.png"
      width="800"

    <figcaption>Husky with a RealSense in RViz showing pointcloud and RGB topics</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

### Interfacing with Husky

Both simulated and real Husky robots expose the same ROS interface, and can be interacted with
in the same way.

:::note

Please make sure that the desktop packages for Husky are installed:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-desktop
```

:::

#### Visualization

You may start a preconfigured [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) instance using the following command:

```
roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
```

#### Control

There are three ways to send your Husky control commands:

1. Using the provided PS4 or Logitech controller. Refer to the [User Manual](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/husky/user_manual_husky/#controller)
   details on how to use the controller.

2. Using the RViz instance above. If you select the Interact option in the top toolbar, an interactive
   marker will appear around the Husky and can be used to control speed.

3. The [rqt_robot_steering plugin](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_robot_steering).
   Run the `rqt` command, and select **Plugins→Robot Tools→Robot Steering** from the top menu.

Husky uses [twist_mux](http://wiki.ros.org/twist_mux) to mix four separate
[geometry_msgs\Twist](http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html) control channels
into the `husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel` topic. See [Motion Topics](#motion-topics) for
the priority levels for the different inputs.

Additional velocity channels can be defined in
[twist_mux.yaml](https://github.com/husky/husky/blob/noetic-devel/husky_control/config/twist_mux.yaml),
or can be piped into the lowest-priority `cmd_vel` topic.

#### Odometry

Husky publishes odometry information on the `odometry/filtered` topic, as
[nav_msgs/Odometry messages](http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html).
These are generated by [ekf_localization_node](http://wiki.ros.org/robot_localization),
which processes data from several sensor sources using an Extended Kalman filter (EKF).
This includes data from the wheel encoders and IMU (if available).

Additional odometry information sources can be added to the EKF in
[localization.yaml](https://github.com/husky/husky/blob/noetic-devel/husky_control/config/localization.yaml).

#### Diagnostics

:::note

Diagnostics are only applicable to real Husky robots, not simulation.

:::

Husky provides hardware and software system [diagnostics](http://wiki.ros.org/diagnostics) on the ROS standard
`/diagnostics` topic. The best way to view these messages is using the
[rqt_runtime_monitor](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_runtime_monitor) plugin. Run the `rqt` command, and select
**Plugins→Robot Tools→Runtime Monitor** from the top menu.

The same information is also published as a
[husky_msgs\HuskyStatus](http://docs.ros.org/api/husky_msgs/html/msg/HuskyStatus.html) message on the status topic.

### Driving Husky {#driving-husky}

There are four ways to drive Husky and each way will work on a physical Husky robot as well as on a simulated Husky.

1. Using the interactive remote controller in RViz. See [Simulating Husky](#simulating-husky).
2. Using autonomous navigation. See [Navigating Husky](#navigating-husky).
3. Using the controller for teleoperation. See below.
4. Publishing ROS messages. See below.

:::warning

Husky is a heavy, robot capable of reaching high speeds. Careless driving can cause harm to the operator,
bystanders, the robot, or other property. Always remain vigilant, ensure you have a clear line of sight to the
robot, and operate the robot at safe speeds.

:::

#### Driving with Remote Controller

:::note

For instructions on controller pairing, [Pairing the Controller](#pairing-the-controller).

:::

<ComponentDrivingWithRemoteController />

##### Using Remote Control with Gazebo

:::note

You can also use a remote controller to drive your robot in Gazebo. To set up your computer for teleop
using the remote controller follow these steps:

1. Connect the controller to your PC.

2. Set the `HUSKY_JOY_DEVICE` environment variable to point to your game controller device
   Normally this will be `/dev/input/js0`.

3. Launch Gazebo as described in [Simulation](#simulating-husky).

:::

#### Driving with ROS Messages

You can manually publish `geometry_msgs/Twist` ROS messages to either the
`/husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel` or the `/cmd_vel` ROS topics to drive Husky.

For example, in terminal, run:

```
rostopic pub /husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.5, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}'
```

The command above makes Husky drive forward momentarily at 0.5 m/s without any rotation. To
have Husky move forward continually, add `-r 10` to the end of the command above.

#### Using rqt_graph

We can also see the structure of how topics are passed around the system. Leave the publishing window running
from the example above (using the `-r 10` option), then open a second terminal window and run:

```
rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
```

This command generates a representation of how the nodes and topics running on the current ROS Master are
related. You should get something similar to the following:

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/rqtgraph.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>rqt_graph snapshot</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The highlighted node and arrow show the topic that you are publishing to the simulated Husky. This Husky then goes on to update the gazebo virtual environment,
which takes care of movement of the joints (wheels) and the physics of the robot.
The `rqt_graph` command is very handy to use, when you are unsure who is publishing to what in ROS.
Once you figure out what topic you are interested in, you can see the content of the topic using `rostopic echo`.

#### Using tf

In ROS, tf is a special topic that keeps track of coordinate frames, and how they relate to each other.
The simulated Husky starts at (0,0,0) in the world coordinate frame. When the Husky moves, its own coordinate
frame changes. Each wheel has a coordinate frame that tracks how it is rotating, and where it is. Generally,
anything on the robot that is not fixed in space, will have a tf describing it.
In the rqt_graph section above, you can see that the `/tf` topic is published to and subscribed from by many
different nodes.

One intuitive way to see how the `tf` topic is structured for a robot is to use the `view_frames` tool
provided by ROS. Open a terminal window and run:

```
rosrun tf view_frames
```

Wait for this to complete, and then run:

```
evince frames.pdf
```

This will bring up something similar to the following image.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/tfframes.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>tf frames snapshot</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Here we can see that all four wheel are referenced to the `base_link`. We also see that the `odom` topic
is driving the reference of the whole robot. This means that if you write to the `odom` topic,
such as when you publish to the `/cmd_vel` topic, then the whole robot will move.

### Keeping Husky Updated

For details on updating Husky software or firmware, refer to [Software Maintenance](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/husky/maintenance_husky#software_maintenance).

## Navigating Husky {#navigating-husky}

There are several options for autonomous navigation for Husky. These are outlined in the
sections that follow.

### Husky Move Base Demo

This tutorial shows you how to use [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) to perform basic
autonomous planning and movement on a simulated Husky, or a factory-standard Husky with a laser
scanner publishing on the `/front/scan` topic.

To adapt this demo to your own Husky, you may need to clone the
[husky_navigation](http://wiki.ros.org/husky_navigation) repository, and modify the relevant
parameters. To learn about [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) and the
[navigation stack](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base), see the
[ROS Navigation Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials).

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure that the Husky navigation demo package is installed:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-navigation
   ```

2. Open window #1 and start the Clearpath-configured Husky simulation environment:

   ```
   roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
   ```

3. Open window #2 and start the Clearpath-configured [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) visualizer:

   ```
   roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
   ```

4. Open window #3 and start the move_base demo:

   ```
   roslaunch husky_navigation move_base_mapless_demo.launch
   ```

5. In the RViz visualizer, make sure the visualizers in the Navigation group are enabled.

6. Use the 2D Nav Goal tool in the top toolbar to select a movement goal in the visualizer.
   Make sure to select an unoccupied (dark grey) or unexplored (light grey) location.

7. Note that in this example, the robot has no absolute localization source, and the
   position estimate will drift relative to the world. See the next tutorial for a demo
   with localization.

### Husky AMCL Demo {#amcl-demo}

This tutorial shows you how to use [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) with
[amcl](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) to perform autonomous planning and movement with localization
on a simulated Husky, or a factory-standard Husky with a laser scanner publishing on the `/front/scan` topic.

To adapt this demo to your own Husky, you may need to clone the
[husky_navigation](http://wiki.ros.org/husky_navigation) repository, and modify the relevant parameters.
To learn about [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base), [amcl](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl), and the
navigation stack, see the [ROS Navigation Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials).

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure that the Husky navigation demo package is installed:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-navigation
   ```

2. Open window #1 and start the Clearpath-configured Husky simulation environment:

   ```
   export HUSKY_LMS1XX_ENABLED=1; roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
   ```

3. Open window #2 and start the Clearpath-configured [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) visualizer:

   ```
   roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
   ```

4. Open window #3 and start the move_base demo:

   ```
   roslaunch husky_navigation amcl_demo.launch
   ```

5. In the RViz visualizer, make sure the visualizers in the Navigation group are enabled.

6. Use the 2D Pose Estimate tool in the top toolbar to give amcl an initial pose estimate.
   Without an initial estimate, the Monte Carlo localization approach is unlikely to converge
   the correct pose.

7. Use the 2D Nav Goal tool in the top toolbar to select a movement goal in the visualizer.
   Make sure to select an unoccupied (dark grey) or unexplored (light grey) location.

8. Note that in this example, the robot uses data from the laser scanner to correct the fused
   odometry estimate, and mitigate drift. The amcl node uses a pregenerated map of this environment
   to compare against incoming scans. See the next tutorial for a demo with localization and mapping.

### Husky Gmapping Demo {#gmapping-demo}

This tutorial shows you how to use [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) with
[gmapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping) to perform autonomous planning and movement with simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), on a simulated Husky, or a factory-standard Husky with a laser scanner
publishing on the `/front/scan` topic.

To adapt this demo to your own Husky, you may need to clone the
[husky_navigation](http://wiki.ros.org/husky_navigation) repository, and modify the relevant parameters.
To learn about [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base), [gmapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping), and the
navigation stack, see the [ROS Navigation Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials).

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure that the Husky navigation demo package is installed:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-navigation
   ```

2. Open window #1 and start the Clearpath-configured Husky simulation environment:

   ```
   export HUSKY_LMS1XX_ENABLED=1; roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
   ```

3. Open window #2 and start the Clearpath-configured [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) visualizer:

   ```
   roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
   ```

4. Open window #3 and start the move_base demo:

   ```
   roslaunch husky_navigation gmapping_demo.launch
   ```

5. In the RViz visualizer, make sure the visualizers in the Navigation group are enabled.

6. Use the 2D Nav Goal tool in the top toolbar to select a movement goal in the visualizer.
   Make sure to select an unoccupied (dark grey) or unexplored (light grey) location.

7. As the robot moves, you should see the grey static map (map topic) grow. Occasionally,
   the Gmapping algorithm will relocalize the robot, causing a discrete jump in the
   map→odom transform.

8. To save the generated map, you can run the map_saver utility:

   ```
   rosrun map_server map_saver -f <filename>
   ```

### Husky Frontier Exploration Demo

:::caution

The `frontier_exploration` package is no longer officially supported in ROS Noetic. These instructions
require building the package from source. Because the package is no longer officially supported support for
any issues you encounter will be limited.

:::

This tutorial shows you how to use [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base)
with [gmapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping) and
[frontier_exploration](http://wiki.ros.org/frontier_exploration) to perform autonomous planning
movement, and exploration with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), on a simulated Husky,
or a factory-standard Husky with a laser scanner publishing on the `/front/scan` topic.

To adapt this demo to your own Husky, you may need to clone the
[husky_navigation](http://wiki.ros.org/husky_navigation) repository, and modify the relevant parameters.
To learn about [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base), [gmapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping),
[frontier_exploration](http://wiki.ros.org/frontier_exploration) and the
navigation stack, see the [ROS Navigation Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials).

#### Preparation

First, you must build the `frontier_exploration` package from source. Create a catkin workspace and
`cd` into it (or `cd` into an existing workspace if you already have one) and clone the code from GitHub:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/paulbovbel/frontier_exploration.git
```

Install any additional dependencies:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

Then make the `exploration_msgs` package:

```
catkin_make --pkg exploration_msgs
```

Once that package is built, source your workspace and build the rest of the package:

```
source devel/setup.bash
catkin_make
```

Make sure you have the `husky_navigation` package installed by running

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-navigation
```

Because `frontier_exploration` is not officially supported by ROS Noetic you will need to modify the following
launch files inside the `husky_navigation` package:

- `launch/exploration.launch`
- `launch/exploration_demo.launch`

Remove the commented-out sections so that the files look like this:

**exploration.launch**:

```markup
<launch>

  <node pkg="frontier_exploration" type="explore_client" name="explore_client" output="screen"/>
  <node pkg="frontier_exploration" type="explore_server" name="explore_server" output="screen">
    <param name="frequency" value="1.0"/>

    <!-- Should be less than sensor range -->
    <param name="goal_aliasing" value="2.0"/>
    <rosparam file="$(find husky_navigation)/config/costmap_common.yaml" command="load" ns="explore_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find husky_navigation)/config/costmap_exploration.yaml" command="load" ns="explore_costmap" />
  </node>
</launch>
```

**exploration_demo.launch**:

```markup
<launch>
  <!--- Run gmapping -->
  <include file="$(find husky_navigation)/launch/gmapping.launch" />

  <!--- Run Move Base -->
  <include file="$(find husky_navigation)/launch/move_base.launch" />

  <!-- Run Frontier Exploration -->
  <include file="$(find husky_navigation)/launch/exploration.launch" />
</launch>
```

#### Running the demo

:::note

In each terminal window, make sure to source the catkin workspace where you built `frontier_exploration`.

:::

1. Ensure that the Husky navigation demo package is installed:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-navigation
   ```

2. Open window #1 and start the Clearpath-configured Husky simulation environment:

   ```
   export HUSKY_LMS1XX_ENABLED=1; roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
   ```

3. Open window #2 and start the Clearpath-configured [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) visualizer:

   ```
   roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
   ```

4. Open window #3 and start the move_base demo:

   ```
   roslaunch husky_navigation exploration_demo.launch
   ```

5. In the RViz visualizer, make sure the visualizers in the Navigation group are enabled.

6. Use the Point tool in the top toolbar to draw a closed polygon on the map that the
   Husky should explore. Watch the terminal window for instructions.

7. As the robot moves, you should see the grey static map (map topic) grow. Occasionally,
   the Gmapping algorithm will relocalize the robot, causing a discrete jump in the map→odom transform.

8. When the exploration goal is complete, you will see a feedback message in the terminal
   window. You can now issue a new exploration goal if you wish.

9. To save the generated map, you can run the map_saver utility:

   ```
   rosrun map_server map_saver -f <filename>
   ```

## Testing Husky {#testing-husky}

Husky robots come preinstalled with a set of test scripts as part of the `husky_tests` ROS package, which can be run to verify robot functionality at the component and system levels.

If your Husky does not have the `husky_tests` ROS package installed already, you can manually install it by opening terminal and running:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-tests
```

### Running ROS Tests

The `ros_tests` script exposes a set of interactive tests to verify the functionality of core features.
These tests run at the ROS-level via ROS topics, and serve as a useful robot-level diagnostic tool for
identifying the root cause of problems, or at the very least, narrowing down on where the root cause(s) may be.

To run `ros_tests` on a Husky robot, open terminal and run:

```
rosrun husky_tests ros_tests
```

Upon running `ros_tests`, a list of available tests will be shown in a menu. From the menu, you can choose
individual tests to run, or simply choose the option to automatically run all the tests.

The details of each test are shown below.

- **Motion Stop Test**

  Checks that the robot's motion-stop is working properly.

  This test subscribes to the `/status` ROS topic and checks that when the motion-stop is manually engaged by
  the user, the motion-stop state is correctly reported on the `/status` ROS topic.

- **ADC Test**

  Checks that the robot's voltage and current values across its internal hardware components are within
  expected tolerances.

  This test subscribes to the `/status` ROS topic and checks that the voltage and current values across
  the internal hardware are within expected tolerances.

- **Rotate Test** (Optional test; only applies to Husky's with an IMU)

  Rotates the robot counter clockwise 2 full revolutions and checks that the motors, IMU, and EKF odometry are working properly.

  This test:

  - Subscribes to the `/imu/data` ROS topic to receive angular velocity measurements from the IMU's Gyroscope.
    These measurements are converted into angular displacement estimations, and the robot will rotate until 2
    full revolutions are estimated.
  - Subscribes to the `/odometry/filtered` ROS topic to receive angular velocity estimations from the EKF
    odometry. These measurements are converted into angular displacement estimations, and are output as comparison
    to the angular displacement estimations from the IMU's Gyroscope.
  - Publishes to the `/cmd_vel` ROS topic to send drive commands to rotate the robot.
  - The user will be asked to verify that the robot rotates 2 full revolutions.

  :::note

  The **Rotate Test** rotates the robot using the IMU's Gyroscope data, which inherently will not be 100% accurate.
  Therefore, some undershoot/overshoot is to be expected.

  :::

- **Drive Test**

  Drives the robot forward 1 metre and checks that the motors, encoders, and encoder-fused odometry are working properly.

  This test:

  - Subscribes to the `/husky_velocity_controller/odom` ROS topic to receive linear displacement estimations from the
    encoder-fused odometry. The robot will drive forward until 1 metre is estimated.
  - Subscribes to the `/joint_state` ROS topic to receive linear displacement measurements from individual the
    encoders. These measurements are output as comparison to the linear displacement estimations from the
    encoder-fused odometry.
  - Publishes to the `/cmd_vel` ROS topic to send drive commands to drive the robot.
  - The user will be asked to verify that the robot drives forward 1 metre.

  :::note

  The **Drive Test** drives the robot using the Odometry data, which inherently will not be 100% accurate.
  Therefore, some undershoot/overshoot is to be expected.

  :::

---

## Advanced Topics {#advanced-topics}

### Calibrating the Magnetometer (UM6 IMU only)

:::warning

Husky will rotate autonomously during calibration. Make sure all external cables are unplugged,
and Husky has unobstructed room to move in a 1 metre radius.

:::

If your Husky has a UM6 IMU installed, you must calibrate the magnetometer for magnetic deviation before
it will be used for pose estimation.

1. Make sure the ros service is running.
2. Execute the calibration script on the Husky computer remotely via SSH:

   ```
   rosrun husky_bringup calibrate_compass
   ```

3. Follow the onscreen instructions. To drive Husky using the included game controller, you must hold
   down either the left or right shoulder buttons (L1 or R2 on a PS4 controller, LB or RB on the
   Logitech F710). Holding the left button will enable normal operation while holding the right button
   will enable turbo speed.

:::warning

When familiarizing yourself with Husky operation, always hold the left button (L1). Once you are
comfortable with how Husky operates, and you are in a large area with plenty of open room, then you
can use the right button (R1) to enable turbo mode.

:::

With either shoulder button held down, and the controller turned on and properly paired, you can use the left joystick
on the controller to drive the robot. The vertical axis controls the robot's forward/backward speed and the horizontal
axis controls the robot's rotation.

### Configuring the Network Bridge

<ComponentConfiguringNetworkBridge />

### Jetson Installation

Refer to the [Jetson](/docs/computers/jetson/jetson_hardware) page for details on installing a Jetson in Husky.

### Additional Simulation Worlds {#additional-sim}

In addtion to the default `husky_playpen.launch` file, `husky_gazebo` contains two additional launch files of use:

- `empty_world.launch`, which spawns Husky in a featureless, infinite plane; and
- `spawn_husky.launch`, which is intended to be included in any custom world to add a Husky simulation to it.

To add a Husky to any of your own worlds, simply include the `spawn_husky.launch` file in your own world's launch:

```markup
<include file="$(find husky_gazebo)/launch/spawn_husky.launch">
  <!-- Optionally configure the spawn position -->
  <arg name="x" value="$(arg x)"/>
  <arg name="y" value="$(arg y)"/>
  <arg name="z" value="$(arg z)"/>
  <arg name="yaw" value="$(arg yaw)"/>
</include>
```

Finally, Clearpath provides an additional suite of simulation environments that can be downloaded separately and used
with Husky, as described below.

#### Clearpath Gazebo Worlds

The Clearpath Gazebo Worlds collection contains four different simulation worlds, representative of different
environments our robots are designed to operate in:

- Inspection World: a hilly outdoor world with water and a cave
- Agriculture World: a flat outdoor world with a barn, fences, and solar farm
- Office World: a flat indoor world with enclosed rooms and furniture
- Construction World: office world, under construction with small piles of debris and partial walls

Husky is supported in all four environments.

#### Installation

To download the Clearpath Gazebo Worlds, clone the repository from GitHub into the same workspace as your Husky:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_gazebo.git
```

Before you can build the package, make sure to install dependencies. Because Clearpath Gazebo Worlds depends on
all of our robots' simulation packages, and some of these are currently only available as source code, installing
dependencies with `rosdep install --from-paths [...]` will likely fail.

All four simulation environments need the `gazebo_ros` package. The Inspection World also needs the
`uuv_gazebo_worlds` package, which can be installed by running:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-uuv-gazebo-worlds
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can build the package:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

#### Running the Inspection Simulation

Inspection World is a hilly, outdoor world that includes a water feature, bridge, pipeline, small cave/mine,
and a small solar farm. It is intended to simulate a variety of missions, including pipeline inspection,
cave/underground navigation, and localization on non-planar terrain.

      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky driving over the bridge in the inspection world</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To launch the inspection simulation, run

```
roslaunch cpr_inspection_gazebo inspection_world.launch platform:=husky
```

To customize Husky's payload, for example to add additional sensors, see
[here](#husky-custom-payload).

Once the simulation is running you can use RViz and other tools as described in
the [Gmapping](#gmapping-demo) and [AMCL](#amcl-demo) demos
to control and monitor the robot.

For example, below we can see Husky exploring the cave:

    <figcaption>Inspection World</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

#### Running the Agriculture Simulation

Agriculture World is a flat, mixed indoor/outdoor world that include a large barn, open fields surrounded by fences,
and a large solar farm. It is intended to simulate missions such as solar panel inspection and area coverage.

    <figcaption>Husky in the Agriculture World</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To launch the agriculture simulation, run

```
roslaunch cpr_agriculture_gazebo agriculture_world.launch platform:=husky
```

To customize Husky's payload, for example to add additional sensors, see
[here](#husky-custom-payload).

Once the simulation is running you can use RViz and other tools as described in
the [Gmapping](#gmapping-demo) and [AMCL](#amcl-demo) demos
to control and monitor the robot.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/common_images/agriculture_world.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Agriculture World</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

#### Running the Office Simulation

Office World is a small indoor environment representing a commercial office space. It features several large, open
areas with furniture, as well as a narrow hallway with smaller offices and meeting rooms. It is intended to simulate
missions in commercial spaces, such as facilitating deliveries, security monitoring, and inspecting equipment.

      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky in the Office World</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To launch Office World with a Husky, run the following command:

```
roslaunch cpr_office_gazebo office_world.launch platform:=husky
```

To customize Husky's payload, for example to add additional sensors, see
[here](#husky-custom-payload).

Once the simulation is running you can use RViz and other tools as described in
the [Gmapping](#gmapping-demo) and [AMCL](#amcl-demo) demos
to control and monitor the robot. For example, below we can see the `gmapping_demo` from `husky_navigation` being

#### Running the Construction Simulation

Construction World is the same basic layout as Office World, representing the same office space under construction/renovation.
It is an indoor environment with small hills of debris/rubble, partial walls, and piles of construction supplies. It
is designed to simulate missions in any sort of construction site.

To launch Construction World with a Husky, run the following command:

```
roslaunch cpr_office_gazebo office_construction_world.launch platform:=husky
```

To customize Husky's payload, for example to add additional sensors, see
[here](#husky-custom-payload).

Once the simulation is running you can use RViz and other tools as described in
the [Gmapping](#gmapping-demo) and [AMCL](#amcl-demo) demos
to control and monitor the robot.

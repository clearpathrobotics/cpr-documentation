## Husky Overview

### Introduction

Husky is a rugged, outdoor-ready unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), suitable for research and rapid prototyping applications.
These tutorials will assist you with setting up and operating your Husky. The tutorial topics are listed in
the right column and presented in the suggested reading order.

For more information or to receive a quote, please [visit us online](http://clearpathrobotics.com/husky).

:::note

These tutorials assume that you are comfortable working with [ROS](https://docs.ros.org/). We recommend starting with
[ROS2 tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html) if you are not familiar with ROS already.

:::

:::note

These tutorials specifically target Husky robots running Ubuntu 20.04 with [ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html).

:::

[Husky ROS Packages](#husky-ros-packages) provides the references for the software packages and key ROS topics.

[Husky Software Setup](#husky-software-setup) outlines the steps for setting up the software on
your Husky robot and optionally on a remote computer.

[Using Husky](#using-husky) describes how to simulate and drive your Husky. [Simuation](#simulating-husky)
is a great way for most users to learn more about their Husky; understanding how to effectively operate Husky
in simulation is valuable whether you are in the testing phase with software you intend to ultimately deploy on a
physical Husky, or you do not have one and are simply exploring the platform's capabilities.
[Driving Husky](#driving-husky) covers how to teleoperate Husky using the remote control, as well as safety
procedures for operating the physical robot. Anyone working with a physical robot should be familiar with this section.

<!-- [Husky Tests](#testing-husky) outlines how to validate that your physical Husky is working correctly. -->

[Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) covers items that are only required in atypical situations.

## Husky ROS Packages {#husky-ros-packages}

Husky fully supports ROS; all of the packages are available in [Husky Github](https://github.com/husky).

### Description Package

The [husky_description](https://github.com/husky/husky/tree/foxy-devel/husky_description) repository
provides a [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) model of Husky.

Husky's URDF model can be visualized in RViz and can be customized and extended through the use of several
environment variables. Once you have installed the desktop software in an upcoming tutorial,
you will be able to run:

```
ros2 launch husky_viz view_model.launch.py
```

### Key ROS Nodes and Topics

#### Nodes

You can use `rosnode list` to see all the nodes running by default on a Husky computer.
The most important nodes are summarized in the following table.

| Node                     | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/husky_node`            | Provides control and communication between the Husky platform and ROS. Accepts velocity commands and provides system feedback on `/status` |
| `/robot_state_publisher` | Subscribes to `/joint_states` and publishes the robot's state to `/tf`                                                                     |

| `/twist_mux`             | Takes in multiple sources of velocity commands, and prioritizes what actually gets sent to the controller                                  |
| `/ekf_localization`      | Part of the robot localization package, more information regarding this package can be found at <http://wiki.ros.org/robot_localization>   |

#### Topics

You can view all topics that are active using `rostopic list`.
The most important topics are summarized in the two tables below.

##### General Topics

| Topic                   | Message type             | Description                                                                                                                        |

## Husky Software Setup {#husky-software-setup}

### Installing and Configuring Robot Software

#### Backing Up Robot Configuration

Upgrading your Clearpath Husky to ROS2 Foxy from older ROS distributions (including ROS1) is supported;
however it's important to understand that each Husky is different, having undergone customization to your
specifications.

Please take the time to understand what these modifications are and how to recreate them on your fresh install of
Ubuntu Focal + ROS2 Foxy.

##### Performing a Backup {#performing-a-backup}

<ComponentPerformingABackup />

#### Upgrading Ubuntu OS Version (Optional)

:::note

If you already have Ubuntu 20.04 installed, you can skip this step.

:::

ROS2 specifically targets Ubuntu 20.04; therefore, if your computer is
currently running an older Ubuntu OS version (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04 for ROS1
Melodic, or Ubuntu 16.04 for ROS2 Kinetic), you will need to update it
to Ubuntu 20.04.

The recommended method of installing Ubuntu 20.04 is from an ISO via a
bootable USB drive. The Ubuntu 20.04 ISO can be found from [Ubuntu's
official releases](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/).

On any computer:

1.  Download the `.iso` file from the link above.
2.  Insert a USB drive.
3.  Write the downloaded Ubuntu 20.04 ISO to the USB drive using a
    software such as `Rufus`, `Etcher`, or `UNetbootin`. This will erase
    all data already on the USB drive, so make sure you have backed up
    anything important!

On the computer to be upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04:

1.  Ensure that it is turned off and has internet access via ethernet.
2.  Insert the newly formatted USB drive.
3.  Turn on and choose to boot from the USB drive.
4.  The installer should run automatically. Step through any prompts
    that come up. The computer will turn off automatically when the
    installation completes.
5.  Once the computer turns off, remove the USB drive and turn on the
    computer. It will now be running your fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04.

#### Removing ROS1 Noetic (Optional)

:::note

If ROS1 Noetic was not previously installed, you can skip this step.

:::

If ROS1 Noetic was previous installed and there is a systemd job to
start it on boot, it must be disabled to use ROS2 on boot. This can be
done by running:

``` bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
rosrun robot_upstart uninstall ros
```

#### Installing ROS2 Foxy

Simply follow the [official ROS2 Foxy installation
instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html) to install
ROS2 Foxy on your Ubuntu 20.04 computer.

If your Ubuntu 20.04 computer for some reason has ROS1 Noetic installed
already, you will just need to `source` the desired ROS version and
distribution before using it.

For example:

``` bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash # Run this command to use ROS2 Foxy
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash # Run this command to use ROS1 Noetic
```

#### Installing Husky Software

:::note

The physical Husky robot comes pre-configured with ROS and the necessary Husky packages already installed;
therefore, you will only need to follow the instructions below if you are re-installing software on the Husky.

:::

:::note

If you wish to install the Husky packages on your computer (e.g. to
interface with the physical Husky robot and/or to simulate Husky), then
proceed with the following instructions below. A prequisite is to make
sure you have a working ROS2 Foxy installation set up on your computer.

:::

##### Add Clearpath Debian Package Repository

Before you can install the Husky packages, you need to configure
Ubuntu's APT package manager to add Clearpath's package server:

1.  Install the authentication key for the
    packages.clearpathrobotics.com repository. In a terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    wget https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

2.  Add the debian sources for the repository. In a terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clearpath-latest.list'
    ```

3.  Update your computer's package cache. In a terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

##### Installing from Debian Packages

The preferred way to install Husky's packages is using precompiled
Debian packages. These packages are available for Ubuntu 20.04.

After your computer is configured to use Clearpath's debian package
repository, you can install the Husky packages needed for this tutorial.
In a terminal, run:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-husky-desktop ros-foxy-husky-simulator
```

The `husky_robot` package only needs to be installed on the physical
Husky robot; however, you can optionally install it on your computer
too. In a terminal, run:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-husky-robot
```

##### Installing from Source

Husky packages are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/husky/), and
can be compiled and installed from source if desired:

1.  Create a workspace directory. In a terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    mkdir -p ~/husky_ws/src
    ```

2.  Clone the Husky repositories into your workspace directory. In
    terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    cd ~/husky_ws/src
    git clone -b foxy-devel https://github.com/husky/husky.git
    cd ..
    ```

3.  Install additional dependencies. In a terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=$ROS_DISTRO -y
    ```

4.  Build the workspace. In a terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    colcon build
    ```

5.  You can now source your workspace to make use of the packages you
    just built. In a terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

6.  If you would like ROS to run on boot run:

    ``` bash
    ros2 run husky_bringup install
    ```

#### Testing Base Configuration

After installing the software, check that the system has started correct.

1. The `COMM` light on your Husky should go from red to green.

2. Your Husky should be accepting commands from your joystick (see next section).

#### Pairing the Controller {#pairing-the-controller}

Joystick controllers are used for teleoperation; they allow you to
remotely drive the Husky, whether it is a physical Husky robot, or a
simulated Husky. The following instructions below detail how to pair
different controllers to the Husky's computer; however, these
instructions can also be used to pair these controllers to your own
computer.

##### PS4 Controller

:::note

If your Husky comes with a PS4 controller, it will be paired already.
Simply turn on the Husky and turn on the controller.
:::

<ComponentPs4ControllerPairing />

##### Logitech F710 Controller

:::caution

Logitech controllers are not considered safe, and usage should be experimental only. If your robot has bluetooth
capabilities, please switch to using a PS4 controller instead.

:::

To re-pair the Logitech F710 controller or pair a new Logitech F710
controller, plug the controller's USB dongle into the Husky's computer
and turn on the controller. The controller pairs automatically.

### Setting up Husky's Network Configuration {#husky-networking}

Husky is normally equipped with a combination Wi-Fi + Bluetooth module.
If this is your first unboxing, ensure that Husky's wireless antennae are firmly screwed on to the chassis.
Some Husky robots may only be equipped with a single antenna, depending on the exact model of PC installed in the robot.

#### First Connection

By default, Husky's Wi-Fi is in client mode, looking for the wireless network at the Clearpath factory.

#### Wi-Fi Setup

<ComponentWifiRobotConnection />

### Remote ROS2 Connection {#remote-computer-software}

:::note

This step is optional.

## Using Husky {#using-husky}

### Simulating Husky {#simulating-husky}

Whether you actually have a Husky robot or not, the Husky simulator is a great way to get started with ROS2
robot development. In this tutorial, we will go through the basics of starting Gazebo and RViz and how to drive
your Husky around.

#### Installation

To get started with the Husky simulation, make sure you have a [working ROS installation](#remote-computer-software)
set up on your Ubuntu desktop, and install the Husky-specific metapackages for desktop and simulation:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-simulator ros-noetic-husky-desktop
```

#### Launching Gazebo

[Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home) is a common simulation tool used in ROS2. Husky's model in
Gazebo includes reasonable approximations of its dynamics, including wheel slippage, skidding, and
inertia. To launch simulated Husky in a simple example world, run the following command:

```
ros2 launch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch.py
```

You should see the following window appear, or something like it.

:::note

You can adjust the camera angle by clicking and dragging while holding CTRL, ALT,
or the Shift key.

:::

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/husky_gazebo_playpen.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Simulated Husky in the Play Pen</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

:::note

To stop the simulation, close the Gazebo window, and then CTRL-C out of the terminal
process.

:::

The window which you are looking at is the Gazebo Client. This window shows you the "true" state of the
simulated world which the robot exists in. It communicates on the backend with the Gazebo Server, which
is doing the heavy lifting of actually maintaining the simulated world. At the moment, you're running
both the client and server locally on your own machine, but some advanced users may choose to run heavy
duty simulations on separate hardware and connect to them over the network.

#### Launch RViz

The next tool we will encounter is [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz). Although superficially similar
in appearance to Gazebo, RViz has a very different purpose--- unlike
Gazebo, which shows the reality of the simulated world, RViz shows the
robot's *perception* of its world, whether real or simulated. So while
Gazebo won't be used with your real Husky, RViz is used with both.

:::note

If you are working with a simulated robot you should leave Gazebo
running and open a new terminal to launch RViz. If you installed the
Husky simulation packages from source, make sure to run
`source devel/setup.bash` in the workspace where the packages are
installed when opening the new terminal.
:::

You can using the following launch invocation to start RViz with a
pre-cooked configuration suitable for visualizing any standard Husky
config:

``` bash
ros2 launch husky_viz view_robot.launch.py
```

You should see RViz appear:

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/husky_images/husky_rviz.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky in RViz</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

### Driving Husky {#driving-husky}

There are four ways to drive Husky and each way will work on a physical Husky robot as well as on a simulated Husky.

1. Using the interactive remote controller in RViz. See [Simulating Husky](#simulating-husky).
2. Using autonomous navigation. This will be covered in a future tutorial.
3. Using the controller for teleoperation. See below.
4. Publishing ROS2 messages. See below.

:::warning

Husky is a heavy, robot capable of reaching high speeds. Careless driving can cause harm to the operator,
bystanders, the robot, or other property. Always remain vigilant, ensure you have a clear line of sight to the
robot, and operate the robot at safe speeds. We strongly recommend driving in normal (slow) mode first, and only
enabling turbo in large, open areas that are free of people and obstacles.

:::

#### Driving with Remote Controller

:::note

For instructions on controller pairing, [Pairing the Controller](#pairing-the-controller).

:::

<ComponentDrivingWithRemoteController />

##### Using Remote Control with Gazebo

:::note

You can also use a remote controller to drive your robot in Gazebo. To set up your computer for teleop
using the remote controller follow these steps:

1. Connect the controller to your PC.

2. Set the `HUSKY_JOY_DEVICE` environment variable to point to your game controller device
   Normally this will be `/dev/input/js0`.

3. Launch Gazebo as described in [Simulation](#simulating-husky).

:::

#### Driving with ROS2 Messages

You can manually publish `geometry_msgs/Twist` ROS2 messages to either the
`/husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel_unstamped` or the `/cmd_vel` ROS2 topics to drive Husky.

For example, in a terminal, run:

```
ros2 topic pub --once /husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel_unstamped geometry_msgs/msg/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.5, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}'
```

The command above makes Husky drive forward momentarily at 0.5 m/s without any rotation. To
have Husky move forward continually, remove `--once` and add `--rate 10` to the command above.

### Keeping Husky Updated

For details on updating Husky software or firmware, refer to [Software Maintenance](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/husky/maintenance_husky#software_maintenance).

<!-- NOTE: Need to add this back in once added for Humble

## Testing Husky {#testing-husky}

Husky robots come preinstalled with a set of test scripts as part of the `husky_tests` ROS package, which can be run to verify robot functionality at the component and system levels.

If your Husky does not have the `husky_tests` ROS package installed already, you can manually install it by opening terminal and running:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-tests
```

### Running ROS Tests

The `ros_tests` script exposes a set of interactive tests to verify the functionality of core features.
These tests run at the ROS-level via ROS topics, and serve as a useful robot-level diagnostic tool for
identifying the root cause of problems, or at the very least, narrowing down on where the root cause(s) may be.

To run `ros_tests` on a Husky robot, open terminal and run:

```
rosrun husky_tests ros_tests
```

Upon running `ros_tests`, a list of available tests will be shown in a menu. From the menu, you can choose
individual tests to run, or simply choose the option to automatically run all the tests.

The details of each test are shown below.

- **Motion Stop Test**

  Checks that the robot's motion-stop is working properly.

  This test subscribes to the `/status` ROS topic and checks that when the motion-stop is manually engaged by
  the user, the motion-stop state is correctly reported on the `/status` ROS topic.

- **ADC Test**

  Checks that the robot's voltage and current values across its internal hardware components are within
  expected tolerances.

  This test subscribes to the `/status` ROS topic and checks that the voltage and current values across
  the internal hardware are within expected tolerances.

- **Rotate Test** (Optional test; only applies to Husky's with an IMU)

  Rotates the robot counter clockwise 2 full revolutions and checks that the motors, IMU, and EKF odometry are working properly.

  This test:

  - Subscribes to the `/imu/data` ROS topic to receive angular velocity measurements from the IMU's Gyroscope.
    These measurements are converted into angular displacement estimations, and the robot will rotate until 2
    full revolutions are estimated.
  - Subscribes to the `/odometry/filtered` ROS topic to receive angular velocity estimations from the EKF
    odometry. These measurements are converted into angular displacement estimations, and are output as comparison
    to the angular displacement estimations from the IMU's Gyroscope.
  - Publishes to the `/cmd_vel` ROS topic to send drive commands to rotate the robot.
  - The user will be asked to verify that the robot rotates 2 full revolutions.

  :::note

  The **Rotate Test** rotates the robot using the IMU's Gyroscope data, which inherently will not be 100% accurate.
  Therefore, some undershoot/overshoot is to be expected.

  :::

- **Drive Test**

  Drives the robot forward 1 metre and checks that the motors, encoders, and encoder-fused odometry are working properly.

  This test:

  - Subscribes to the `/husky_velocity_controller/odom` ROS topic to receive linear displacement estimations from the
    encoder-fused odometry. The robot will drive forward until 1 metre is estimated.
  - Subscribes to the `/joint_state` ROS topic to receive linear displacement measurements from individual the
    encoders. These measurements are output as comparison to the linear displacement estimations from the
    encoder-fused odometry.
  - Publishes to the `/cmd_vel` ROS topic to send drive commands to drive the robot.
  - The user will be asked to verify that the robot drives forward 1 metre.

  :::note

  The **Drive Test** drives the robot using the Odometry data, which inherently will not be 100% accurate.
  Therefore, some undershoot/overshoot is to be expected.

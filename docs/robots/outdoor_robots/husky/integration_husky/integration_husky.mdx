To attach custom hardware to Husky, you will have to take care of mechanical mounting, electrical
supply, and software integration. This guide aims to equip you with respect to these challenges.

## Mechanical Mounting

When determining mechanical mounting, you have two options, both of which are described below.

- the "Standard" aluminum extrusion interface
- the "PACS" mounting system and associated kits

### Mechanical, Standard

A standard Husky is delivered with a 20 X 20 aluminum extrusion frame around the top of the user bay.
This can be used for mouning sensors, lights, and other small attachments.
We suggest using the following items to interface with this extrusion:

## Electrical Integration

Except for bus-powered USB cameras, most payloads have separate leads for power and data.

### Data Connections

Data connections (USB and Ethernet) are made to the Husky computer mounted in the user bay.
In addition, the PCIe Gen3 x16 slot may be used to supply a GPU or other attachements, as necessary.
Additionally, the user bay may be used for an Ethernet switch, when attaching multiple
Ethernet payloads, or for a PoE power injector as required.

### User Bay Power Connections

The user bay power connections are capable of supplying:

- VBAT (approximately 24-29 V, unregulated) fused at 5 A
- 12 V fused at 7.5 A
- 24 V fused at 3 A.

In total, 282 W of power is available from these User Power breakouts.

:::note

You can order a upgrade for your Husky, that will add 480 W of power (VBAT fused at 20 A). Each terminal comes equipped with a
removable connector into which your payload power leads may connect.

:::

:::note

Husky UGVs with serial numbers lower than A200-0802 have different user power connections.  
These older robots have 5 V, 12 V, and 24 V supplies, all fused at 5A.
Your Husky's serial number is shown on a sticker, attached to the right side of the robot.

:::

To connect to user power:

1.  Expose about 5 mm of bare wire from the payload power leads and twist the exposed wire on both leads.
2.  Take 2 Molex terminals from the spare parts kit provided and insert the exposed wire and crimp the
    terminals, ensuring the wires are well secured inside the terminal, as shown below.
3.  Take 1 connector housing from the spare parts kit provided and insert the positive payload power lead
    (red) into position 4, 5, or 6 of the connector until it locks into place. The positions numbers are
    visible on the back of the plastic housing.
4.  Insert the negative payload power lead (black) into position 1, 2, or 3 of the connector until it locks
    into place.

When connecting payloads, be sure to observe correct polarity as marked on the inside of the user bay.
Do not exceed the specified maximum current limit of each power rail; failure to do so may result in
damage to Husky or your payload.

For more technical information on the Molex power connectors, as well as their corresponding mating connectors,
please visit the
[Digi-Key WM23702-ND Product Page](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/molex/0039012065/930272?s=N4IgTCBcDaIOoFkwGYDsAGMBaAcgERAF0BfIA).

### Serial Connection

The pinout of the DE-9 connector is shown below.

### External Motion Stop  {#husky_external_stop}

      width="600"

    <figcaption>E-stop Safety Loop connector inside the Husky user bay</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

There is a connector labeled _E-STOP SAFETY LOOP_ that is inside the Husky's user bay.
The connector has 2 contacts that lead to the Husky MCU circuit board.
The MCU supplies +12 V on one of these leads, and monitors the voltage on the other lead.
The MCU will place the Husky in a Stop state if the monitored line is below +12 V.

Your robot may have a connector that adds a jumper wire between these 2 leads to complete the circuit;
or your robot may have more Stop switches in series with this circuit.
These additional components in series may be:

* Emergency Stop buttons
* [Wireless Stop receivers](/docs/accessories/wireless_stop_system)
* Relays or similar PLC components
* Manipulator control cabinets

:::info

* The connector labeled _E-STOP SAFETY LOOP_ is a [Switchcraft EN3P2FX](https://www.switchcraft.com/en3-harsh-environment-panel-mount-2-contact-female/en3p2fx/)
* The mating connector is a [Switchcraft EN3C2MX](https://www.switchcraft.com/en3-harsh-environment-cable-mount-2-contacts-male/en3c2mx/) ( _Clearpath Robotics item 008075_ )

:::

:::note

This was an optional upgrade kit on Huskies built before March 2023.
Clearpath Robotics still offers this upgrade kit to add an external motion stop to an older Husky.
Contact [Support](#support) for details.

:::

:::warning

This is a single channel Stop loop, being monitored by a microcontroller.
The when the microcontroller is in a Stop state; it will open relays which supply power to the Husky's motor controllers.
These relays are not force guided or monitored.

Please contact [Support](#support) if you need more information for your application's risk assessment.

### MCU Debug LEDs

The Husky MCU PCBA comes equipped with LEDs for debugging.
They work as follows:

- **D16: HEARTBEAT**: toggles every 500 ms when the main firmware loop on the MCU is running.
- **D7: VBAT 20 A**: illuminated if the VBAT, 20 A fuse is good.
  This LED will be off if the fuse is blown.
- **D8: VBAT 5 A**: illuminated if the VBAT, 5 A fuse is good.
  This LED will be off if the fuse is blown.
- **D12: 12 V 7.5 A**: illuminated if the 12 V, 7.5 A fuse is good.
  This LED will be off if the fuse is blown.
- **D10: 24 V 3 A**: illuminated if the 24 V, 3 A fuse is good.
  This LED will be off if the fuse is blown.

:::note

On older revisions of the Husky MCU PCBA, the labels are different, but the functionality is similar:

- D5: HEARTBEAT
- D2: VBAT, 5 A
- D3: 12 V, 5 A
- D4: 5 V, 5 A

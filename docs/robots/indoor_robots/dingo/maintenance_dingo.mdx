## Battery Care

### Lead-Acid Battery Care

Dingo's default power supply is a sealed 12 V lead-acid battery pack (VRLA), providing 20 Ah of charge.
These tips are intended to help keep your Dingo Lead-Acid Battery in tip-top shape.
With proper maintenance, the battery should maintain the majority of its capacity for hundreds of cycles.

Your robot's battery charger works in 3 stages:

1.  Constant current charging or bulk charge (9 to 14.6 V @ 6 A): indicator LED is red
2.  Constant voltage charging or topping charge (14.6 V @ 6 A down to 2 A): indicator LED is red
3.  Trickle or Float charge (14.6 V @ 2 A down to 0 A): indicator LED is green

The bulk of the capacity (70%) is regained during the first stage.

It is important to let the charger complete all 3 stages whenever possible, to help maintain the life of the battery.
The initial stage will take 3 - 5 hours, and a complete charge may take up to 10 hours, depending on the
depth of discharge.

### LiFEPO<sub>4</sub> Battery Care

:::note

LiFEPO<sub>4</sub> are not available for Dingo 1.0. They are only available for Dingo 1.5 and newer.

:::

Dingo's optional power supply is a Lithium Iron Phosphate battery pack (LiFEPO<sub>4</sub>),
providing minimum 20 Ah of charge. These tips are intended to help keep your Dingo LiFEPO<sub>4</sub> Battery
in tip-top shape. With proper maintenance, the battery should maintain the majority of its capacity for
thousands of cycles, typically a 10x increase over SLA batteries.

The LiFEPO<sub>4</sub> battery charger works in 3 stages:

1. Constant current charging or bulk charge (9 to 14.6 V @ 7 A): indicator LED is red
2. Constant voltage charging or topping charge (14.6 V @ 7 A down to 0.7 A): indicator LED is red
3. Balancing or Float charge (14.6 V @ 0.7 A down to 0 A): indicator LED is green

The bulk of the capacity (70%) is regained during the first stage.

It is important to let the charger complete all 3 stages whenever possible, to help maintain the life of the battery.
The initial stage will take 2 - 4 hours, and a complete charge may take up to 8 hours, depending on the depth of discharge.

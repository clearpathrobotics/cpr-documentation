## Introduction

Dingo is a lightweight and easy-to-use unmanned indoor ground vehicle for ROS.

There are two Dingo variants:

- **Dingo-D** uses differential drive and has two module bays, one of which must be a battery module; the second module is typically a computer module.
- **Dingo-O** uses omnidirectional drive and has four module bays, at least two of which are typically battery modules; the other modules may be computer modules or networking equipment.

While in "Idle" and "Driving" states, the user can override the LEDs by publishing to the `/mcu/lights` topic.

#### DC Shore Power

Dingo provides a DC Shore Power connection (internal connector for Dingo 1.0; external connector for Dingo 1.5) to allow the system to be powered without requiring batteries to be present.
Note that when DC Shore Power is connected, the motors are disabled and it is not possible to drive the Dingo; however, all other electronics (computers, sensors, etc) will remain enabled.

##### Dingo 1.0 Shore Power Notes

For Dingo 1.0, to connect the shore power, remove the top trough cover (to access the MCU) and then attach the shore power cable to the 2-port connector labelled "SHORE" on the MCU (see [Electrical Integration](#dingo-payload-electrical-integration) for details).

##### Dingo 1.5 Shore Power Notes

For Dingo 1.5, users can also connect the manual charger while using DC Shore Power to allow the batteries to charge fully with no load present on them.

The DC Shore Power supply is an off the shelf Mean Well power supply, part number GST280A15-C6P. This power supply is a 15V, 225W AC/DC converter with a 6 position Molex connector that plugs into the mating port on the front of the Dingo.

#### Orientation References

The reference frame used by all Clearpath Robotics ground robots is based on ISO 8855.

When commanded with a positive translational velocity (forward), wheels travel in the positive X-direction.
The direction of the axes differs from those used for roll, pitch, and yaw in aircraft, and care should be taken to ensure that data is interpreted correctly.

## Getting Started

You are ready to go! This section details how to get Dingo into action.
To begin, place Dingo "up on blocks" as described in the [Safety](#safety) section, making sure that the wheels are clear of the ground.

For most Dingo setups, there will be an Onboard Computer which is directly connected to the Dingo and a Remote Computer which is used to control Dingo and gather data.
These two computers must be set up to communicate with each other.

### Onboard Computer Setup

If you purchased an Onboard Computer from Clearpath Robotics with Dingo, it is already installed, connected, and powered.
If not, or to set up your own Onboard Computer, see the [Dingo Tutorials](/docs/robots/indoor_robots/dingo/tutorials_dingo).

Note that the Onboard Computer must be connected to Dingo's Ethernet port, which is accessible in the center channel.

### Powering Up

If you've just unpacked Dingo from its packaging, you may need to open it up and connect the battery.

Press the power button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-power.png" width="20" /> on Dingo's HMI panel.
The LEDs should show a test pattern, after which you will wait about 30 seconds for the internal computer to finish booting up.
Once it has finished booting, the Comms indicator <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-comms.png" width="20" /> should turn green.
This indicates that ROS is up on the computer and has established communications with the Dingo base.

### Network Configuration

To get Dingo connected to your local Wi-Fi network, you must first access the Onboard Computer using a wired connection to the robot.
Remove the top trough cover and the appropriate yellow fairing to access the computer module, then connect to one of the network ports with a standard Ethernet cable.
See the [Dingo Tutorials](/docs/robots/indoor_robots/dingo/tutorials_dingo#dingo-networking) for details.

### Connecting and Using the Controller {#controller}

To use your controller, it must be paired with your Dingo and powered on.
If your purchased the Onboard Computer from Clearpath Robotics, your controller is already paired with your Dingo.
If your controller has become unpaired or if you wish to pair a new controller, following the instructions in the [Dingo Tutorials](/docs/robots/indoor_robots/dingo/tutorials_dingo#pairing-the-controller).

To teleoperate Dingo, first clear the motion-stop.
Then, power on the controller by pressing the `PS` button on the controller.
Once the blue LED on the top of the controller goes solid, you are paired and ready to drive.

Hold the L1 trigger button (deadman switch) and push the left thumbstick forward to drive the Dingo.
For full speed mode, hold the R1 trigger.
See the figure below for the Sony PS4 controls layout.
If you are not seeing any action, refer to [Support](#dingo-support) to get in touch with support.

### Using ROS

<ComponentUsingRos />

### Battery Charging

#### Dingo 1.0 Battery Charging

When finished with the Dingo, press and release the power button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-power.png" width="20" /> to power it off.
Then remove the batteries for charging.

Dingo's batteries are charged outside the Dingo using the charger(s) provided.

Alternatively, if you have multiple batteries, you can hot-swap them one at a time.
The system will remain operational while hot-swapping as long as there is at least one battery in the system or the system is connected to shore power prior to removing the batteries.
Note that plugging in shore power will engage a motion-stop and it is not possible to drive Dingo while connected to shore power.

The Sealed Lead-Acid batteries have overcurrent protection in the form of an ATO fuse.
The lithium batteries include integrated protections against fault due to overcurrent, overdischarge, and short circuit.
The batteries are rugged and designed for the demanding environments into which Dingo may be deployed.

#### Dingo 1.5 Battery Charging

To charge the batteries, simply connect the manual charger to the charge port on the front of the Dingo. Charging can take place while the unit is powered,
or unpowered, or while the unit is connected to DC Shore Power. The charging current for the SLA system is 6A, and 7A for the LiFEPO<sub>4</sub> system. Care must be
taken when charging while the system is powered, as if the load/total current is higher than the supplied charge current the batteries will continue to drain.
If the total system current is less than the charge current the batteries will charge, but at a reduced rate as the system will be using a portion of the
charger current to maintain operation.

#### Common Battery Charging Notes

For multi-battery systems the charge current is distributed across the number of batteries present in the system, so charging time will increase appropriately.
Care should be taken when removing or installing batteries. The batteries must be at the same charge level or voltage before connecting them together in the system.
The easiest way to ensure this is to have an external charger, and by charging each battery individually with that charger to a full charge so all batteries are at
the same charge level (or voltage). Once at the same level it is ok to connect them together in the unit. Failure to follow this procedure can result in
battery/system damage and/or personal injury.

However, please take note of the following:

- SLA batteries must be charged while in a 0 to +45 ◦C range and discharged while in a -30 to +60 ◦C range.
- Lithium batteries must be charged while in a 0 to +50 ◦C range and discharged while in a -20 to +60 ◦C range.
- LiFEPO<sub>4</sub> batteries must be charged within a 0 to +45 ⁰C range and discharged while in a -20 to +60 ⁰C range

Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Dingo's batteries or for information about purchasing additional batteries.

## Safety Considerations {#safety}

Clearpath Robotics is committed to high standards of safety.
Dingo contains several features to protect the safety of users and the integrity of the robot.

:::caution

Dingo is a fast moving robotic platform. Please read the following notices carefully.

:::

### General Warnings

Dingo is a rugged and high-performance vehicle.
For the safety of yourself and others, always conduct initial experiments and software development with the vehicle raised off the ground.
Place a wooden crate, a set of sawhorses, a sturdy storage tub, or any other solid flat structure having a height greater than 150 mm (6 inches) under Dingo to keep the wheels clear of the ground ("up on blocks").

When starting out, favour slower wheel speeds.
Dingo's control loops can accurately maintain velocities as low as 0.1 m/s.
Operating at such speeds will give you more time to react if things don't go quite as you expect.

### Motion Stop Buttons {#dingo-stop-buttons}

The Motion Stop button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-motor.png" width="20" /> is located on the HMI Panel at the back of Dingo.
To engage Stop Mode, press the Motion Stop button once; you should see that the green LED by the Motion Stop button is flashing and that all four corner LEDs are flashing red.
To disengage Stop Mode, press the Motion Stop button again; all LEDs should return to their original values.

When in Stop Mode, the Dingo will not drive.
The commands received while in Stop Mode are not buffered; Dingo will always act on the latest commands received.
This means that if the commands are stopped before the Motion Stop button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode, the Dingo will not move.
If the commands are continued, Dingo will move at the speed commanded once the Motion Stop button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode.

Ensure that the Motion Stop button is accessible at all times.
Avoid mounting payloads that extend over the rear of Dingo and would block access to the Motion Stop button.

Note that the Dingo MCU board does provide a breakout to allow an external motion-stop button/switch to be integrated by the end user, which could be used to engage/disengage Stop Mode.
See [Optional External Motion Stop](/docs/robots/indoor_robots/dingo/integration_dingo#dingo-external-motion-stop) for details on adding an external motion-stop button/switch.

### Electrical System

Dingo is powered by batteries capable of delivering over 2000W for short durations.
This gives Dingo's motors their great performance; however, it is also enough power to cause severe bodily harm.
Always use caution when operating Dingo to avoid personal injury or property damage.
To ensure safety, please observe the following precautions:

- Do not tamper with the battery terminals or wiring.
- Do not tamper with the fuses, except to check and change the fuses.
- Always replace fuses with the same type and rating to ensure continued protection against risk of fires.
- Consult Clearpath Robotics support if you need to service the batteries.
- Do not lay tools or other objects on top of the batteries.
- Charge the battery only with the charger provided by Clearpath Robotics.
- Please dispose of the batteries properly or return them to Clearpath Robotics to do so.

### Lifting and Transport

- Ensure that Dingo's Stop Mode is engaged when transporting short distances and powered off when transporting longer distances.
- Do not push the robot at more than 0.5 m/s (1.6 ft/s) or damage to the motor controls may occur.

### Performance Considerations

Included in Dingo are native software checks and limits to protect the robot.
However, it is recommended to monitor the system's status during usage with the `/status` and `/diagnostics` topics.
These topics provide useful information regarding voltages, currents, temperatures and general health of the system.

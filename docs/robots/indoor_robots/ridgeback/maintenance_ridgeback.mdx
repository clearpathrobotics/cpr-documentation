## Battery Replacement

If Ridgeback's batteries need replacement, they are accessible by removing the top-plate and the insulator
cover. Before performing any service or maintenance to the robot, the battery pack must be fully disconnected.
The batteries weigh approximately 33 kg (73 lbs) each, so use care and caution when lifting the
batteries out of the chassis. Please contact Clearpath Robotics regarding replacement batteries.

It may also be necessary to remove the antenna cables carefully prior to removing the batteries.

## Long-term storage

When storing Ridgeback for long periods of time, its important to properly maintain the batteries to fully
maximize their life. Consider one of the following two procedures when placing Ridgeback in long-term storage:

- Fully charge Ridgeback, turn it off and put it into storage. Once a week, connect power to the charger
  and allow the charger to top up the battery for an hour or so.
- Fully charge Ridgeback, turn it off and put it into storage, but leave the charger connected and powered
  the entire time Ridgeback is in storage via a wall timer that turns off for one hour every 24-hour cycle.
  The charger will monitor the battery and will automatically charge it up as needed. Note that the wall
  timer is needed since the charger times out and turns off otherwise.

Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Ridgeback's batteries.

### MCU Firmware Update

When you update packages, there is periodically a new version of Ridgeback's firmware available. You will know this
is the case in one of two ways:

1. The firmware and Onboard Computer are unable to connect to each other, which will be apparent if the body lights remain solid
   red after system bootup.
2. If the firmware version number in the `/status` message does not match the package version output by
   `dpkg -s ros-noetic-ridgeback-firmware`. In the future there will be an automated check for this which outputs
   a diagnostics warning when a firmware update is available to be applied.

If new firmware is available, follow the below procedure to flash it to Ridgeback's MCU:

1. Place Ridgeback up on blocks. Firmware loading does not usually result in unintended motion, but it's safest when
   off the ground.
2. Ensure that Ridgeback is on and open.
3. Connect the MCU to the Ridgeback's Onboard Computer using a mini-USB cable connected to the port shown below:

  </figure>
</center>

4. In the middle of the MCU is a two-position switch labelled `PWR MODE`. Move the switch from the default `NORM`
   position to the `AUX` position.
5. Press the `M_RST` button. The MCU is now in boot-loader mode, ready to receive new firmware.

:::note

The Ridgeback's MCU is normally rotated 90 degrees when it is installed in the robot; the `NORM` position is
typically towards the top of the robot's chassis and the `AUX` position is normally towards the bottom.

:::

Now, from Ridgeback's Onboard Computer (connected via SSH or screen/keyboard), execute:

```
rosrun ridgeback_firmware upload
```

You should see about 20 seconds worth of lines output beginning with "Download from image ...".

When the upload is complete, move the `PWR MODE` switch back to the `NORM` position and immediately press the
`M_RST` button.

:::note

You must press the `M_RST` button immediately after changing the mode back to `NORM`. If you take too long
the Ridgeback may power off. If this happens, simply ensure the switch is in the `NORM` position and power
the robot back on normally. Losing power in this situation is inconvenient, but not harmful.

:::

After resetting the MCU back in `NORM` mode, ensure the MCU is using the new version of the firmware by running

```
rostopic echo /status
```

and verifying that the MCU firmware version is correct.

## Boxer Overview

:::caution

This guide is for the Boxer V2.4 (released in November 2021) and V2.5 (released in May 2023). Boxer V2.4 and V2.5 are not compatible with the older Boxer (V2.2).
Owners of previous-generation (V2.2) Boxers should refer to the documentation [here](http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/boxer/).

:::

:::note

OTTO Motors and Clearpath Robotics operate under the same parent company.
Boxer V2.4 and V2.5 are a collaboration between the teams at OTTO Motors and Clearpath Robotics.

### Introduction

Boxer is a large indoor mobile robot for prototyping and development of industrial applications.
It is a lightly modified [OTTO 100](https://ottomotors.com/amrs) robot, equipped with a Backpack Computer mounted
to the top of the Base Unit. This Backpack Computer communicates with the OTTO 100 via its attachment port, located
on the top of the Base Unit.

The Boxer is currently only supported in [ROS 1](/docs/ros1noetic/robots/outdoor_robots/boxer/tutorials_boxer). 

For more information or to receive a quote, please [visit us online](http://clearpathrobotics.com/boxer).

<!-- NOTE: This info needs to be included somewhere and modified to make sense for the ROS 2 implementation unless it is covered in indoorNav

### Terminology

The following terms are used throughout this guide:

- Backpack Computer: the externally-mounted computer that has the ROS Master running on it.
- Base Unit: the OTTO 100 platform, including its internal computer. Sometimes referred to as "The OTTO 100".
- Boxer: the combined Base Unit and Backpack Computer.

### Differences from OTTO 100

The most obvious difference between OTTO 100 and Boxer V2.4/V2.5 is that Boxer has been painted black with a yellow
stripe on the sides. This change is purely cosmetic, and is to keep the Boxer visually distinct.

Mechanically, the top deck of the Boxer has a slightly thicker, heavier top-plate with a different arrangement of
mounting holes than the OTTO 100. This is to allow the attachment of additional payloads, such as robotic arms,
larger sensor arrays, and structural elements.

  </figure>
</center>

Finally, the OTTO 100's attachment interface and ROS2 API have been enabled. This is necessary to allow the
Backpack Computer to communicate with and control the robot.

### Operating Boxer

Boxer is intended to be controlled via the Backpack Computer; all necessary ROS nodes, and the ROS Master, are running on
the Backpack Computer. Any topics published by or subscribed to from the OTTO 100's internal computer are relayed from the
Backpack Computer.

When the robot powers on it will be in neutral. Use the OTTO App to disengage the safeties and enable operation of
the robot. Note that this requires that the Base Unit be connected to your wireless network. Refer to
[Network Setup](#boxer-networking) for more details.

One ethernet port of the Backpack Computer is reserved for communicating with the Base Unit. By default this is the
port identified as `eno1`, labelled "LAN1" on most computers. All other ethernet ports on the Backpack Computer are
bridged together and may be used for diagnostics, connecting external computers, or adding IP-based accessories such as
lidar sensors, cameras, or robotic arms.

### ROS2 API

OTTO Motors has developed a ROS2 API that is available to monitor and control the Base Unit. When using ROS Noetic,
Boxer uses `ros1_bridge` nodes to translate this ROS2 API into ROS1 compatible messages.

The ROS2 API operates on 3 domains:

| Domain ID | Description  |
| :-------- | :----------- |
| 100       | Fleet API    |
| 110       | Autonomy API |
| 95        | Platform API |

Refer to the [OTTO 100 documentation](https://ottomotors.com) for more details on the ROS2 API.

### Standard Sensors

The Base Unit includes a number of sensors whose data can be consumed by ROS nodes running on the Backpack Computer:

- front-facing safety lidar, available as `/front/scan`
- rear-facing safety lidar, available as `/rear/scan`
- internal IMU, available as `/imu/module0/data_raw`
- front-facing Intel RealSense camera
  - depth data available as `/realsense/depth/image_rect_raw`
  - depth camera info available as `/realsense/depth/camera_info`

At the time of writing OTTO Motors' ROS2 API does not expose pointcloud or RGB data from the RealSense camera

## Boxer Backpack Computer Software Setup {#boxer-software-setup}

:::caution

All of the software instructions in this section apply only to the Backpack Computer, not the
software running on the Base Unit. If your Boxer is not equipped with a Backpack Computer,
you can skip this section.

:::

#### Configuring the Backpack Computer

If you are installing the packages on Boxer's Backpack Computer, you will need to set up `/etc/ros/setup.bash`
too:

```
# Mark location of self so that robot_upstart knows where to find the setup file.
export ROBOT_SETUP=/etc/ros/setup.bash

# Setup robot upstart jobs to use the IP from the network bridge.
# export ROBOT_NETWORK=br0

# Insert extra platform-level environment variables here. The six hashes below are a marker
# for scripts to insert to this file.
######

# Pass through to the main ROS workspace of the system.
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

# Source your catkin workspace
# Make sure to use the complete path, and avoid using envars like $HOME
# Omit this if you do not have a workspace
source /home/administrator/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

# Set the ROS_ROBOT_SERIAL_NO and BOXER_API_VERSION envars
# this is required for the Boxer to operate correctly
# The serial number must match the one stamped on the back of the robot
export ROS_ROBOT_SERIAL_NO=A31_0123456789
export BOXER_API_VERSION=v1_3

# Any additional environment variables that depend on your workspace should be exported here
# e.g.
#export BOXER_URDF_EXTRAS=/path/to/boxer_customizations.urdf.xacro
```

The `BOXER_API_VERSION` environment variable must be set on the robot's Backpack Computer. This version is determined by
the version of the ROS2 API running on the Base Unit.

At the time of writing the latest version of the OTTO software uses `v1_3`

The `ROS_ROBOT_SERIAL_NO` environment variable must match the serial number stamped on the back of the robot.
The serial number is case-sensitive, and will begin with `A31_`, followed by a series of numbers.

Finally, after you have configured `/etc/ros/setup.bash` you can run the following to create the ROS systemd jobs
that will start ROS automatically when the Backpack Computer start up:

```
source /etc/ros/setup.bash
rosrun boxer_bringup install
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start ros
sudo systemctl start ros-bridge
```

### Setting up Boxer's Network Configuration {#boxer-networking}

Boxer is normally equipped with a combination Wi-Fi + Bluetooth module.
If this is your first unboxing, ensure that Boxer's wireless antennae are firmly screwed on to the chassis.
Boxer is equipped with a Backpack Computer mounted to the top of the Base Unit. The Base Unit is
also equipped with an internal computer. This section explains how to configure the networking for the Backpack Computer only. For
instructions on connecting the Base Unit's computer to a network, refer to the [OTTO 100 Documentation](https://docs.ottomotors.com).

#### Enabling the OTTO App

Many of Boxer's features are accessible via the OTTO App. This requires configuring the Base Unit to connect
to your Wi-Fi network. To do this, connect your laptop to the diagnostic ethernet port on the rear of the Base Unit.
Configure your laptop to have a static IP address on the 10.255.255.0/16 subnet, e.g. 10.255.255.100.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://10.255.255.1:8090. You will be promted to enter your network credentials.

Refer to [OTTO Motors' documentation](https://docs.ottomotors.com/en/30495-30526-connecting-a-robot-to-a-network.html)
for more details on configuring the Base Unit's networking.

## Mapping and Navigating with Boxer {#navigating-boxer}

:::note

Boxer includes the latest autonomy software from OTTO, including [Fleet Manager](https://ottomotors.com/fleet-manager).

Please refer to [OTTO Motors' documentation](https://docs.ottomotors.com) and the OTTO 100 user manual
for details on how to use OTTO's advanced autonomy software

:::

This section explains how to use basic navigation demos with Boxer. These examples can be used with a simulated Boxer
or with the physical robot. Note that if you are using the physical Boxer you also have access to the much more
advanced OTTO autonomy software.

To get all Navigation related files for Boxer, run:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-boxer-navigation
```

Below are the example launch files for three different configurations for navigating Boxer:

- Navigation in an odometric frame without a map, using only [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base).
- Generating a map using [Gmapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping).
- Localization with a known map using [amcl](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl).

If you are working in a simulation, bring up Boxer using the following command:

```
roslaunch boxer_gazebo boxer_race.launch
```

This will spawn Boxer in a relatively enclosed environment

      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Boxer in its simulated environment</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

If you're working with a real Boxer, it's suggested to connect wirelessly via SSH and launch the ROS launch files from onboard the robot.
You'll need to have bidirectional communication with the robot's roscore in order to launch RViz on your workstation (see [here](#remote-computer-software)).

### Navigation without a Map

In the odometry navigation demo Boxer attempts to reach a given goal in the world within a user-specified tolerance.
The 2D navigation, generated by `move_base`, takes in information from odometry, laser scanner, and a goal pose and outputs safe velocity commands.
In this demo the configuration of move_base is set for navigation without a map in an odometric frame (that is, without reference to a map).

To launch the navigation demo, run:

```
roslaunch boxer_navigation odom_navigation_demo.launch
```

To visualize with the suggested RViz configuration launch:

```
roslaunch boxer_viz view_robot.launch config:=navigation
```

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/robot_images/boxer_images/boxer_rviz_odom_navigating.png"
      width="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Boxer driving to its 2D Nav Goal in RViz</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To send goals to the robot, select the _2D Nav Goal_ tool from the top toolbar, and then click anywhere in the RViz view to set the position.
Alternatively, click and drag slightly to set the goal position and orientation.

If you wish to customize the parameters of move_base, local costmap, global costmap and base_local_planner, clone [boxer_navigation](https://github.com/boxer-cpr/boxer/tree/noetic-devel/boxer_navigation) into your own workspace and modify the corresponding files in the `params` subfolder.

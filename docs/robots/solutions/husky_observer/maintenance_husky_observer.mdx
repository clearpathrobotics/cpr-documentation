## Hardware Maintenance

### Charging the Robot {#charging}

The robot can be charged wirelessly with the Autocharge Dock or with a wired
connection with the Manual Charger.

#### Autocharge Dock

The operator can start charging the robot using the autocharge dock in two ways,
noting that the robot will only charge on the dock when the disconnect is in the
"ON" position.

- Manually drive the robot to its position at the dock. The receiver on
  the robot should be properly aligned with the circle on the dock transmitter.
- Use the OutdoorNav UI to dock the robot autonomously. Please consult
  [Autonomous Missions](#autonomous-missions) for further details.
  This method requires that the [base station has been surveyed](#survey-base-station),
  the [Datum has been set to the coordinates of the test site](#set-datum),
  and that the [dock location has been set](#set-dock-location).

#### Manual Charger

The Manual Charger may be used when the robot is far from its wireless
charger or when a faster charge time is desired. For faster charging,
first turn off the robot.

TODO: Possibly update some of the wording here for the new charger.

- Plug the manual charger into an AC outlet and wait for the power
  light to turn solid **<span style={{color: '#0000ff'}}>BLUE</span>**.
- Remove the cap from the manual charging port (rear of robot) by
  squeezing the two cap sides and lifting.
- Connect the manual charger plug into port.

After a moment the **<span style={{color: '#e38e4e'}}>ORANGE</span>**
"lightning bolt" will illuminate on the charger indicating that charging
has begun. The **<span style={{color: '#38761d'}}>GREEN</span>** battery level
indicator on the charger will also flash. When both segments of this
indicator turn solid, charging is complete.

Be sure to replace the charge port cap when charging is complete. This
will protect the connectors from environmental conditions.

### Balancing Batteries

The robot's batteries must be balanced on a regular basis to ensure accurate
feedback, consistent performance, and long life. If the batteries are
allowed to fall out of balance, they will become unevenly loaded. This can
lead to back-feeding between batteries, reduced charge-holding capacity
for the system as a whole, and increased stress on both batteries.
If the imbalance becomes severe enough, one of the system batteries
will enter a protective state and disconnect itself from the system.
Once the battery enters this state there is a limited time window to
recover it. If that window expires the battery will become irreversibly
damaged with no possibility of recovery.

Battery balancing is a slow process that will occur automatically when
the fully-charged batteries are held at their float voltage. Because the
automatic charger will shut off when it determines that the batteries are
fully charged, the system cannot be balanced using the autocharge dock.
The manual charger must be used.

To perform a "quick" balance, leave the robot plugged into the manual
charger overnight. A quick balance is recommended at least once per week.
A full balance of 24+ hours is recommended at least once per month.

Contact Clearpath Robotics for assistance with recovering a battery that
has entered a protective state.

### Checking Battery Health

A regularly-balanced battery system can be recharged thousands of times
before degrading. Eventually, however, the batteries will degrade (their
usable capacity will decrease). This translates to reduced run-time and
range. The robot will need to be recharged more frequently and overall
system availability will be reduced.

It is recommended that the system operator review runtime performance
once per year to determine whether battery replacement is required.
Runtime measurements should be taken immediately after a full balancing
operation. Battery replacement is performed by Clearpath Robotics and
is subject to battery availability. Replacement batteries may be
purchased in advance and warehoused at Clearpath for future use.

### Checking Drivetrain Health

Depending on the environment in which the robot is used in and duty cycle,
the robot drivetrain may require maintenance during its life. Maintenance
activities can include gearhead replacement, tire tread replacement, motor
brush replacement, belt replacement, bearing replacement, etc.

It is recommended that the user perform an auditory inspection of the
robot drivetrain once per month. Take note of any clicking, grinding or
irregular skipping sounds while the robot is moving. Note that some clicking
in the gearheads is normal during stops and starts, due to backlash between
the gears.

### Checking Wheels

Tire pressure may change with temperature and should be checked monthly
with a pressure gauge. Inspecting tires, releasing pressure, and inflating
tires are completed through the tire's inflation stem. Tire pressure should
not exceed 138 kPa ( 20 psi ), and lower pressure may be desired based on
terrain requirements.

A monthly visual inspection of the tire treads is also recommended.
Replacement wheel assemblies can be purchased from Clearpath Robotics and
can be installed by the user.

If a tire must be removed, first unfasten the four
M5 Socket Head Cap Screws that join the wheel to the axle hub, then slide
the wheel off the axle. When replacing the wheel, screws should be
lubricated with Loctite® 243 and then tightened to 5 N·m ( 3.7 ft-lb )
torque.

### Cleaning LiDARs

The lenses of both the 2D and 3D LiDARs must
be cleaned on a regular basis. Contamination of the 3D LiDAR
can result in a "stuck" robot and sub-optimal navigation performance.
Contamination of the 2D LiDAR can result in poor docking
performance and inability to automatically maintain battery charge.

Once per week or as required, visually inspect the lenses for dust or
dirt. Use a clean microfiber cloth to gently wipe away any contaminants.
Do not use cleaners or chemicals on the LiDAR lenses, as they may damage
the optical coating.

### Cleaning Cameras

The robot's camera lenses should be cleaned at least once per month.
The cleaning procedure is the same as that for the LiDAR lenses.

### Cleaning Dock Target

During the autonomous docking process, the white material of the dock
target provides high remission from the Sick LMS-111 laser scanner.
Over time, as the material is exposed to the elements dust/particles
may build up on the white plastic part of the dock target and will
require some maintenance.

This maintenance simply consists of cleaning the white plastic panels
with a microfiber cloth. Ensure that the surfaces are clear of any dust,
dirt and/or any other particulate matter.

## Storage, Shipping, and Disposal

### Storing Husky Observer for Extended Periods

All batteries self-discharge over time. To minimise the risk of battery
state-of-charge dropping to a dangerously low leve while in storage, the
robot should be fully-charged and fully-balanced before being put into storage.
In addition, batteries in long-term storage will need to be recharged
every 6 months.

The rate of discharge should also be minimised by disconnecting the batteries
from the rest of the system. This is achieved by means of a disconnect switch
in the robot's rear panel. Turn this switch to "OFF" prior to storing the
robot for long periods.

### Preparing Husky Observer for Shipping

The following should be considered when preparing to ship the robot and its
associated equipment:

- Risk of equipment damage due to shock, vibration and impact
- Risk of equipment damage due to extreme temperatures
- Risk of equipment damage due to contamination, including liquid ingress
- Risk of equipment damage and injury due to over-charged or over-discharged lithium-ion batteries
- Risk of injury as a result of imbalanced or shifting loads
- Risk of environmental damage due to invasive species and/or hazardous material release

Note the shipping temperature ranges and ingress protection ratings in the
[System Specifications](/docs/robots/solutions/husky_observer/user_manual_husky_observer#system-specifications).
Secure all equipment using appropriately-rated rigging.
Protect the equipment from mechanical damage, liquid ingress and exposure to
caustic environments (including sea air). If lumber is used, ensure that it
has been appropriately treated to prevent the spread of invasive species.

Lithium-ion batteries (which includes the robot's integrated lithium iron
nanophosphate batteries) are considered dangerous goods in many jurisdictions.
Ensure that the appropriate dangerous goods signage and paperwork is in place
prior to shipping the robot (as applicable). Note that the wireless motion-stop
system includes two small stand-alone lithium-ion batteries, and the remote
control gamepad includes an integrated lithium-ion battery.

Some jurisdictions require battery states of charge to remain within a certain
band during transport. Consult local regulations.

For short-duration transports lasting up to several days, it is recommended
that all batteries be charged to the maximum state of charge permitted by
applicable regulations. Disconnection of the robot's internal batteries is not
required.

For longer-duration transports more than several days, the guidelines for
extended storage should be followed (to the degree allowable by applicable
regulation).

</center>

The robot and associated equipment contain materials that should not be
disposed of in a landfill. These include lithium-ion batteries and leaded
solder, and may include cadmium, toxic lubricants and adhesives, and
other materials that can be harmful to people, animals and ecosystems.

All printed circuit board assemblies, wiring harnesses and other
electronics components such as sensors, computers, human-machine
interface components, lights and motors should be treated as "e-waste"
and disposed of in accordance with local regulations. Lithium-ion
batteries should be treated as hazardous goods and disposed of in
accordance with local battery disposal regulations.

Below are troubleshooting tips for Husky Observer. Refer also to [Husky Troubleshooting](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/husky/troubleshooting_husky) for
troubleshooting tips related to the base Husky.

## Missions

1. **The robot position and/or heading are behaving erratically
    while the robot is stationary. What should I do?**

    If this occurs, power cycle the robot by turning the Battery Disconnect Switch
    to the "OFF" position, waiting 10 seconds, turning the disconnect to the
    "ON", allowing 1-2 minutes for the software to startup, and then refresh
    the UI page.

1. **How do I start, pause or stop a mission?**

    Refer to the [OutdoorNav User Manual](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_autonomous_mode#mission-execution).

1. **When I start a Mission the robot does not move. What could be the problem?**

    There could be one of several reasons for this happening:

    1. Check that none of the onboard Motion-Stop actuators are activated.
    1. Check that the wireless Motion-Stop is not engaged and the
        <span style={{color: '#38761d'}}>GREEN</span> start button has been pressed to
        release the Motion-Stop.

        This can be checked via the UI (a red Status Indicator means Motion-Stop is
        engaged) or the onboard robot lights (will flash when Motion-Stop is engaged).

    1. Ensure that at least 1 Goal is enabled in the Goal Panel.

    1. Check that the task settings have all been set for each Goal in the Mission.
        A missing task setting for a Move PTZ task will block the execution of the Goal
        it is in.

1. **How do I delete a Waypoint?**

    Make sure the "Edit Missions" toggle is enabled, then click the "Waypoint Mode"
    button. Now you can click the Waypoint you wish to delete. A dropdown list will
    appear. Select "Delete".

1. **How do I add a Task to a Goal?**

    Refer to the [OutdoorNav User Manual](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_autonomous_mode#add-task).

1. **How do I remove a Waypoint from an existing Goal?**

    Open the Goal Panel.  Select the Goal which you want to edit and expand the
    Waypoint list, if necessary. Make sure the "Edit Missions" toggle is
    enabled. On the map, select the Waypoint you would like to remove. It will
    be highlighted in the Goal Panel. You can then click the "x" beside that
    Waypoint in the Goal Panel to remove it from the Goal.

1. **How do I add a Waypoint to an already existing Goal?**

    Open the Goal Panel. Make sure the "Edit Missions" toggle is enabled.
    Select the Goal which you want to add the Waypoint to. Select the Waypoint
    on the map. There will be a menu option to "Add Waypoint to Current Goal".
    This will add the waypoint to the beginning of the goal. You can then drag
    and drop the Waypoint in the Goal Panel to place it in the order you need.
    This will only be possible using a mouse or touchpad as the touchscreen
    will not allow you to drag/drop the Waypoint.

1. **Why is the "Save Image" Task failing?**

    Check the Goals that are enabled in your Goal Panel. If you see a red
    warning triangle beside the "Save Image" task it means that the
    settings for this task were not set. Set them and rerun the mission.

1. **The navigation gets stuck on the "Compute Path" feedback. What should I do?**

    If this occurs, power cycle the robot by turning the disconnect to the
    "OFF" position, waiting 10 seconds, turning the disconnect to the "ON",
    allowing 1-2 minutes for the software to startup, and then refresh the
    UI page.

## Autonomous Docking

1. **When trying to dock, my robot drives towards the dock but stops
    2 m away and remains there. "Docking Failed" is displayed in the UI
    feedback bar. How can I fix this?**

    It is likely that one of these 3 things occured:
    1. The base station was recently resurveyed, or
    1. The datum was recently changed, or
    1. The dock location was not set correctly.

    If any of these have occured recently and you did not reset the dock location
    from the UI, you will need to do so by following the instructions in
    sections [Survey Base Station](/docs/robots/solutions/husky_observer/user_manual_husky_observer#survey-base-station),
    [Set Datum](/docs/robots/solutions/husky_observer/user_manual_husky_observer#set-datum), and
    [Set Dock Location](/docs/robots/solutions/husky_observer/user_manual_husky_observer#set-dock-location).

## System

1. **The E-stop light is illuminated. How do I resolve this?**

    This light indicates that one of the E-stop sources (4 on the robot, one
    remote) is actived. Once all sources have been deactivated, the light
    will turn off.

1. **The joystick does not seem to work well. How do I resolve this?**

    The joystick is intended for operation and debugging when in close proximity
    to the robot. It should be functional at a range of up to 10 meters, when there is direct
    line of sight from the joystick to the robot. Note that the OutdoorNav UI virtual joystick is
    intended to be the primary way to perform teleoperation of the robot for larger ranges.

1. **The robot turned off when there was still 20% battery left as shown in the UI.
    Why did the robot turn off?**

    Draining the batteries all the way down to 0% can lead failure of the batteries and,
    in the worst case, the damage could be permanent. To prevent this from occurring, the
    robot powers itself off automatically when the battery level reaches 20% to protect the
    batteries. Connect the manual charger to the robot to allow the battery level to recover
    above 20%.

These are the standard addresses that Clearpath uses for custom robot configurations.
The details of your specific integration should have been included with your robot as a _robosmiths memo_ stating the device, serial number, and IP address.

This chart is for reference, to help you decide what address to assign sensors or computers that you are adding to a robot.

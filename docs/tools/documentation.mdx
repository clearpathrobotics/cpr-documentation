This website uses a Markdown â†’ HTML generator called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
We have changed the configuration settings so the website can get authentication data from AWS ( Amazon Web Services ).
These changes allow us to show or hide content based on your login privileges.
There is a Sign In button on this page, that will check if you have a valid Username and Password from our AWS database.

For example, here is some content that is only visible with sufficient privileges:

<hr />
<br />

<InjectPrivilegedContent content={someBlockedContent} />

<br />
<hr />

<details><summary><b>Not seeing anything above?</b> Click here to expand.</summary>

This is what you would have seen above, if you had login privileges:

<SomeBlockedContent />

<br />

<ContactSupportForAccess />

</details>

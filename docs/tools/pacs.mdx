## Overview

PACS is a Clearpath Robotics standard for adding componts to a robot.
Our robots have mounting plates with a 80 mm X 80 mm grid of M5×0.8 threaded holes.
This allows us to add sensors and attachments using adapter plates.
The _Parts Lists_ in our [Sensors pages](/docs/sensors) include these 80 mm X 80 mm brackets.
Some example brakets are also detailed in the [Common PACS Items section](#pacs_common_pacs_items_for_all_robots) below.

Once a sensor has been mounted onto the robot, we let ROS know where it is located using our PACS script.
This script will ask you questions like:

- What sensor is this?
- Where is the sensor on the robot?
  - Column ( _A_, _B_, _C_, _..._ )
  - Height ( [Top plate](/docs/robots/husky/integration_husky/top_plate_husky), [Riser](/docs/robots/husky/integration_husky/riser_partial_husky) )
  - Row ( _1_, _2_, _3_, _..._ )
  - Is it on a [Tower](/docs/accessories/tower)
- Have you turned the sensor relative to the standard facing forward direction?

You can see these same configuration options when you build a robot on [build.clearpathrobotics.com](https://build.clearpathrobotics.com/).
The number of rows and columns is dependent on the robot platform.
Refer to the integration pages for our robots for more details:

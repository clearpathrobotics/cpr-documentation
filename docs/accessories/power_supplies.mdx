Clearpath's robots include User Power connectors with regulated 5 V, 12 V, and 24 V depending on the robot platorm.
Refer to your robot platform's user manual for more details about these User Power connections:

- [Boxer](/docs/robots/boxer/user_manual_boxer)
- [Dingo](/docs/robots/dingo/user_manual_dingo)
- [Husky](/docs/robots/husky/user_manual_husky)
- [Jackal](/docs/robots/jackal/user_manual_jackal)
- [Ridgeback](/docs/robots/ridgeback/user_manual_ridgeback)
- [TurtleBot4](/docs/robots/turtlebot4/user_manual_turtlebot4)
- [Warthog](/docs/robots/warthog/user_manual_warthog)

If you need more power, or at a different output voltage, you can add an enclosed DC-DC power supply.
This is our process for choosing a new enclosed power supply.

## Process For Choosing A Power Supply

1. Go to [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/filter/dc-dc-converters/132) or [Mouser](https://www.mouser.ca/c/power/dc-dc-converters/?orgKeyword=dc-dc%20converter), and search for _DC-DC Converter_
2. Filter the results for _Active_ items.
3. Filter for your preferred Manufacturer, such as:
   - CUI Inc.
   - Delta Electronics
   - MEAN WELL
   - Murata
4. Filter for your intended output voltage.
5. Filter for your required minimum output current or power.
6. Review the results, and find options that have an input voltage range matching your robot's battery.
   For example, a Power Supply with an input voltage range of 18 - 36 VDC is acceptable for a Husky with a lead acid battery, since the Husky's battery volage will be between 24 - 29 VDC.
7. Review the allowable operating temperature range, and confirm that it is acceptable for your applicaiton.
8. Review the Power Supply's datasheet, looking for mechanical mounting as well as shock & vibration requirements.

   :::tip

   There are Power Supplies that include mounting brackets for [DIN Rails](/docs/accessories/din_rail), which could simplify your integration.

9. Review the electrical termination method to see if it is ideal for your application. It is common to see screw terminals for [Ring Terminals](/docs/components/connectors/ring_terminal), though there are other options.

We like to think of robots being a mobile base, with sensors and software.
Unfortunately, we need to add lots of hardware and less glamarous software to make it seem like robots are that simple.
We've listed the documentation for some of these additional subsystems, like:

- Wi-Fi and networking
- Lights
- Controllers
- Power Supplies
- Cabling and Electrical considerations
- Brackets and Mechanical considerations

We suggest you:

1.  Review our documentation of these accessories.
2.  If you want Clearpath Robotics to integrate sensors and accessories on your robot, contact our Sales team at <sales@clearpathrobotics.com>, whether you want to use a new Clearpath Robotics platform, or reuse your existing vehicle.
3.  Contact our Support team at <support@clearpathrobotics.com> if you have any questions.

We use these Relay Boards from [Numato Lab®](https://numato.com/) for controlling lights, larger relay-contactors, and similar powered devices.
The relay board is wired to a ROS computer with a USB cable, and appears in the computer's _/dev_ directory as a serial device.
We have developed a ROS driver using Numator's API, so we can control the relays through _rosservices_, and monitor the GPIO inputs through _rostopics_.

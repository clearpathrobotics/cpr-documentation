Our Base Station is a Network Access Point inside a weatherproof enclosure.

It includes:

- A weatherproof enclosure mounted to a tripod
- A network access point and antenna to create a Wi-Fi network
- An AC-DC power supply
- A battery and charger, so you can use the Base Station remotely

Our robots are configured to automatically connect to the Base Station's Wi-Fi network.
You can then connect your development computer to the Base Station through Wi-Fi or a network cable, and then share data with the robot over Wi-Fi.
Our standard Base Station can send data at 100 Mbit/s at up to 100 metres range.

We also have a GPS variant of the Base Station where we add a [Swift Navigation Duro](/docs/sensors/gps/swift_navigation_duro) to the system, connecting it to the Access Point with a network cable.
This GPS sensor allows the robot to apply an RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) correction for more accurate localization.

:::note

Clearpath uses this RTK correction in its OutdoorNav autonomy software, but we do not use this data in the standard _/odometry_ rostopic.

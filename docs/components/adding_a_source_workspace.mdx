Configuring non-standard peripherals requires a source workspace on the robot computer.

:::tip

The instructions below use `cpr_noetic_ws` as the workspace name. You can choose a different
workspace name and substitute it in the commands below.

:::

1. Create a new workspace:

   ```
   mkdir -p ~/cpr_noetic_ws/src
   ```

2. Add any custom source packages to the `~/cpr_noetic_ws/src` directory.

3. After adding your packages, make sure any necessary dependencies are installed:

   ```
   cd ~/cpr_noetic_ws/
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro noetic -y
   ```

4. Build the workspace:

   ```
   cd ~/cpr_noetic_ws/
   catkin_make
   ```

5. Modify your robot-wide setup file (`/etc/ros/setup.bash`) to source your new workspace instead
   of the base noetic install:

   ```
   source /home/administrator/cpr_noetic_ws/devel/setup.bash
   ```

6. Reinitialize your environment so that it picks up your new workspace:

   ```
   source /etc/ros/setup.bash
   ```

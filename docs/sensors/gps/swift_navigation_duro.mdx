### Instructions

1.  Fasten the attachment-plate (ID 1) to the robot using M5 screws (ID 3)
2.  Mount the sensor (ID 2) to the attachment-plate (ID 1) using four M6 screws (ID 4).
3.  Connect the M12-4-D to RJ45 network cable included in the sensor kit (ID 2) to the sensor and robot's computer or network switch
4.  Reterminate the M12-5-A power cable included in the sensor kit (ID 2) so it can provide 12 VDC or 24 VDC to the sensor.

## Troubleshooting

**Sensor is not turning on**

1.  Check that the M12-5-A cable is fully seated in the sensor
2.  Check that the other end of this cable is terminated correctly, per your robot's User Power breakout
3.  Check that the User Power connector is fully seated
4.  Use a multimeter on the VDC setting to confirm that the User Power breakout is at 12 V or 24 V when the robot is on.
    If not, you should check your fuses, and power supplies for damage.
5.  Check the M12-5-A connector's voltage across pins 1 and 3.
    This should read 12 V or 24 V, assuming the User Power breakout measured earlier was working.
    If you read 0 V, then this indicates a damaged cable.

**Cannot ping the sensor on the robot's computer**

1.  Turn the robot on.
2.  Connect your laptop to a spare RJ45 Ethernet port on the robot.
3.  Configure your laptop's Ethernet port to a static address of _192.168.131.250_, and a subnet of _255.255.255.0_
4.  In a new terminal session, enter `ping 192.168.131.31`
5.  The sensor if working properly if you receive reply messages.
6.  If you do not get reply messages, then the issue is likely:
    1.  Your Ethernet cable has an issue
    2.  Your laptop's Ethernet port is not configured properly
    3.  Network devices between the computer and camera are turned on (PoE-switch or PoE-injector, Network Switches)
    4.  The sensor's IP address is not the same as what you entered into the terminal
    5.  The sensor is not on

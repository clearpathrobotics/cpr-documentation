### Instructions

1.  Remove the camera's white plastic covering, by removing the four Torx screws.
2.  Mount the sensor's base (ID 2) to the attachment-plate (ID 1) using four M4 screws (ID 4).
3.  There is white painted lettering on the robot's top plate.
    This lettering designates sensor locations on the robot.
    Take note of the location that you have mounted this sensor.
    You will need this sensor location during software installation, to make sure your robot's URDF is configured correctly.
4.  The network cable (ID 7) to the camera's RJ45 jack.
    Connect the other end of the network cable to a PoE-switch, or PoE-injector.
5.  Reinstall the camera's white plastic covering, and Torx screws.

## Troubleshooting

**Sensor is not turning on**

1.  Turn the robot on
2.  Check that the RJ45 connector is fully seated in the camera.
3.  Check that the RJ45 connector is fully seated in the PoE-switch or PoE-injector.
4.  Check all cables and connectors between the computer and camera.
5.  Check that the network devices between the computer and camera are turned on (PoE-switch or PoE-injector, Network Switches)
6.  Try replacing all RJ45 network cables between the computer and camera.
    This is necessary if the exising cable has been pinched, or experienced some other physical damage.
7.  You may try to power the sensor using the camera's 2-position terminal block, with a 24 VDC supply, at up to 0.6 A of current.
8.  If the sensor has not powered on, there is likely an issue with the camera.
    You should contact Clearpath Robotics to see about a possible warrenty claim, or to try further troubleshooting steps.

**Cannot ping the sensor on the robot's computer**

1.  Turn the robot on
2.  Connect your laptop to a spare RJ45 Ethernet port on the robot
3.  Configure your laptop's Ethernet port to a static address of _192.168.131.250_, and a subnet of _255.255.255.0_
4.  In a new terminal session, enter `ping 192.168.131.20`
5.  The sensor if working properly if you receive reply messages
6.  If you do not get reply messages, then the issue is likely:
    1.  Your Ethernet cable has an issue
    2.  Your laptop's Ethernet port is not configured properly
    3.  Network devices between the computer and camera are turned on (PoE-switch or PoE-injector, Network Switches)
    4.  The sensor's IP address is not the same as what you entered into the terminal
    5.  The sensor is not on

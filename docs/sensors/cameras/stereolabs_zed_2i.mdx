### Instructions

1.  Mount the sensor (ID 2) to the attachment-plate (ID 1) using a #1/4-20 screw (ID 3) and spacer (ID 4).
    Use the centre hole in the attachment-plate for mounting the sensor.
2.  Mount this assembly onto your robot, using the included spacers (ID 5) and screws (ID 6).
3.  Connect a the sensor's included USB 3.0 cable to one of the robot's USB 3.0 jacks.
4.  Connect the other end of the USB cable to the sensor.
5.  There is white painted lettering on the robot's top plate.
    This lettering designates sensor locations on the robot.
    Take note of the location that you have mounted this sensor.
    You will need this sensor location during software installation, to make sure your robot's URDF is confured correctly.

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot see sensor data**

1.  Turn the robot on
2.  Connect your laptop to a spare RJ45 Ethernet port on the robot
3.  Configure your laptop's Ethernet port to a static address of _192.168.131.250_, and a subnet of _255.255.255.0_
4.  SSH into the robot's computer using `ssh administrator@192.168.131.1` and enter the password `clearpath`
5.  Then enter `cd /dev` and finally `ls`
    - unplug the sensor's USB cable, and enter `ls`
    - look for any changes to the listed devices in the directory
    - you should see the sensor appear as a drive
    - try changing the USB cable and the USB 3.0 port on the computer and repeat these steps

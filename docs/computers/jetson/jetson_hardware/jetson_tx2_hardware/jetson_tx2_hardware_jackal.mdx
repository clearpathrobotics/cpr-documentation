## Installation

:::note

This page outlines the steps for installing the TX2 hardware in Jackal. See also
the instructions for
[installing the Jetson software](/docs/computers/jetson/jetson_software).

:::

### Step 1: Remove Mini-ITX Computer

### Step 2: Install the TX2

1. Install the Jetson TX2 using M3 screws or the screws removed from the computer. The holes
   will only line up in one orientation.
2. Plug a USB mini cable from the Jetson to the Jackal MCU board. This is beside where the USB
   header was removed if you had a computer. We recommend using a USB hub to increase the number
   of connected devices.

3. Plug the power switch cable into the power switch header (J6).

4. If you wish to use the antenna cables attached to the Jackal, remove the U.FL connectors from
   the Jetson module and connect the antenna cables.

   :::caution

   Take your time with this step as the UF.L connectors are fragile. If you wish not to disconnect the UF.L
   cables you can replace the antenna mounts on the Jackal with SMA extensions.

5. Make a power cable that connects to the 12 V user
   power (Molex connector) to a barrel connector with center positive. Refer
   to the [Jackal User Manual](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/jackal/user_manual_jackal) for the
   pinout of the user power.

   :::warning

   Do NOT plug this into the ITX power plug on the power distribution board.

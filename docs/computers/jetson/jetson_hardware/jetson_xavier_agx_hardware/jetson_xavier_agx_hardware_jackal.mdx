### Step 2: Install the Xavier AGX

Custom mounting brackets are available on
[Github](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/jetson_setup/raw/melodic/models/JetsonNanoXavierJackalMount.stl).

1. Print this mount off using a 3D printer. A 0.2 mm layer thickness should be sufficient.

2. Use an allen wrench to remove the support feet from the bottom of the Xavier board by removing the M3 bolts.
   Place the feet on the 3D printed mount.

3. Attach the Xavier to the mount using four M3x40 screws through the bottom of the mount in the holes for Xavier.

5. Make a power cable that connects to the 12V user
   power (Molex connector) to a barrel connector with center positive. Refer
   to the [Jackal User Manual](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/jackal/user_manual_jackal) for the
   pinout of the user power.

   :::warning

   Do NOT plug this into the ITX power plug on the power distribution board.

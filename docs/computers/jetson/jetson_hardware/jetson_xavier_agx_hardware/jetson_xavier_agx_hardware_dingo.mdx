## Installation

:::note

This page outlines the steps for installing the Xavier AGX hardware in Dingo. See also
the instructions for
[installing the Jetson software](/docs/computers/jetson/jetson_software).

:::

### Step 1: Open up Dingo

Start by removing Dingo's side panels, yellow cover plates, and removing the center channel covers.

### Step 2: Install the Xavier

Dingo includes pre-threaded mounting holes for the Jetson Xavier. We recommend using 20 mm standoffs to raise the board.

Connect the Jetson's power cable to the 12 V output from Dingo's MCU.

The ethernet port on the Jetson will eventually need to be connected to the ethernet port of Dingo's MCU. If you have
a network switch installed you can connect the MCU and the Jetson to the switch. Otherwise leave the MCU disconnected
for now so that the Jetson's ethernet port can be used for downloading the software from the internet.

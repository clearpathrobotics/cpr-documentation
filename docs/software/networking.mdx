For details on setting up wired and wireless networking connections to your Clearpath
robot, refer to the robot-specific tutorials, such as [this Husky tutorial](http://localhost:3000/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/husky/tutorials_husky#husky-networking).

### SSH and SFTP

Clearpath robots ship with an SSH server operating on port 22 for remote login.  This server also supports sftp for
file-transfer to/from the robot if needed.  By default you can log in using the default username and password for the
robot.


### Internal Networking

All Clearpath robots use the `192.168.131.0/24` subnet for any permanently-installed network hardware.  This includes,
but may not be limited to
- the robot's primary PC,
- the robot's MCU,
- a secondary PC (if present),
- any cameras, lidar, or other sensors that communicate over ethernet, and
- any long-range wireless radios.

The `192.168.131.0/24` subnet is statically configured; all devices are configured to use a static IP address, and
there is normally not a DHCP server operating on this subnet.

For a list of standard payload IP addresses, please see [network IP addresses](/docs/tools/network_ip_addresses).


### Clock Synchronization

If your robot contains multiple computers, their clocks must remain synchronized to allow proper communication between
ROS nodes running on each one.  Clearpath configures the computers to use `chrony` to synchronize the clocks, with the
primary PC being the authoritative source for the others.

For details on configuring `chrony`, please see [configuring NTP](/docs/tools/ntp).

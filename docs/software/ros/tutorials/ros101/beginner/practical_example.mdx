Now that you understand the basics, here's how they can apply to a
practical example. Follow along to see how we actually 'do' all of these
things....

1.  First, you will need to run Ubuntu 20.04, and have ROS Noetic
    installed on it. For your convenience, you can download our
    easy-to-use image here:

    https://s3.amazonaws.com/CPR_PUBLIC/LEARN_ROS/ROS_Edu.zip<br/>
    **Login (username):** user<br/>
    **Password:** learn

2.  Get VMWare Player, and use the virtual disk above. If you don't want
    to use the provided image, follow the tutorial here (after
    installing Ubuntu 20.04):
    <http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu>

    Throughout the rest of the tutorials, we will be referencing the ROS
    cheatsheet available [here](http://bit.ly/1RCVMaB).

3.  Open a new Terminal Window (Ctrl + Alt + T). In the new terminal,
    type roscore (And press enter) This should produce something similar
    to the below.

What you have just done is started the ROS Master as we described above.
We can now experiment with some ROS commands.

Open a new **Terminal**, and type in **rostopic**. This will give you a
list of all the options that the rostopic command can do.

For now, we are interested in rostopic list. Type in **rostopic list**.
(And press enter). This should give you a window like the following:

The two entries listed above are ROS's built in way of reporting and
aggregating debug messages in the system. What we want to do is publish
and subscribe to a message.

You can open a new **Terminal** again, or open a new tab on the same
terminal window (Ctrl + Shift + T). In the new Terminal, type in
(**NOTE:** This command will not work if you try to copy paste it into
your terminal):

```
rostopic pub /hello std_msgs/String "Hello Robot"
```

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/PExamplethree.png)

Let's break down the parts of that command.

**rostopic pub** -- This commands ROS to publish a new topic.

**/hello** -- This is the name of the new topic. (Can be whatever you
want)

**std_msgs/String** -- This is the topic type. We want to publish a
string topic. In our overview examples above, it was an image data type.

**"Hello Robot"** -- This is the actual data contained by the topic.
I.E. the message itself.

Going back to the previous Terminal, we can execute rostopic list again.

We now have a new topic listed! We can also echo the topic to see the
message by entering **rostopic echo /hello**.

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/PExamplefour.png)

We have now successfully published a topic with a message, and received
that message. Type **Ctrl + C** to stop echoing the /hello topic. We can
also look into the node that is publishing the message. Type in
**rosnode list**. You will get a list similar to the one below. (The
exact numbers beside the rostopic node may be different)

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/PExamplefive.png)

Because we asked rostopic to publish the /hello topic for us, ROS went
ahead and created a node to do so. We can look into details of by typing
**rosnode info /rostopic/\_.....(whatever numbers)**

**TIP:** In ROS, and in Linux in general, whenever you start typing
something, you can press the Tab key to auto-complete it. If there is
more than one entry, double tap Tab to get the list. In the above
example, all I typed was rosnode info /rost(TAB)

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/PExamplesix.png)

We can get info on our topic the same way, by typing **rostopic info
/hello**

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/PExampleseven.png)

You will notice that the node listed under "Publishers:" is the same
node we requested info about.

Up till now, we have covered the fundamentals of ROS, how to use
rostopic, rosnode.

Next time, we will compile a short example program, and try it out.

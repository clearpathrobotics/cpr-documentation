## Updating the Virtual Machine

Open a terminal window (Ctrl + Alt + T), and enter the following:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-desktop
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-simulator
```

## Running a Virtual Husky

Open a terminal window, and enter:

```
roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_empty_world.launch
```

Open another terminal window, and enter:

```
roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
```

You should be given two windows, both showing a yellow, rugged robot
(Husky!)

**RViz**

**Gazebo**

The left one shown is Gazebo. This is where we get a realistic
simulation of our robot, including wheel slippage, skidding, and
inertia. We can add objects to this simulation, such as the cube above,
or even entire maps of real places.

The right window is RViz. This tool allows us to see sensor data from a
robot, and give it commands (in a future post).

We can now command the robot to go forwards. Open a terminal window, and
use the command below, copy pasting this one won't work! You can tab
complete this command by hitting the tab key after geometry_msgs/Twist:

```
rostopic pub /husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist
"linear: x: 0.5 y: 0.0 z: 0.0 angular: x: 0.0 y: 0.0 z: 0.0" -r 10
```

In the above command, we publish to the
**/husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel topic**, of topic type
**geometry_msgs/Twist**. The data we publish tells the simulated Husky
to go forwards at 0.5m/s, without any rotation. You should see your
Husky move forwards. In the gazebo window, you might notice simulated
wheel slip, and skidding.

## Using rqt_graph

We can also see the structure of how topics are passed around the
system. Leave the publishing window running, and open a terminal window.
Type in:

```
rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
```

This command generates a representation of how the nodes and topics
running on the current ROS Master are related. You should get something
similar to the following:

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/rqtgraph.png)

The highlighted node and arrow show the topic that you are publishing to
the simulated Husky. This Husky then goes on to update the gazebo
virtual environment, which takes care of movement of the joints (wheels)
and the physics of the robot. The rqt_graph command is very handy to
use, when you are unsure who is publishing to what in ROS. Once you
figure out what topic you are interested in, you can see the content of
the topic using **rostopic echo**.

## Using tf

In ROS, tf is a special topic that keeps track of coordinate frames, and
how they relate to each other. So, our simulated Husky starts at (0,0,0)
in the world coordinate frame. When the Husky moves, it's own coordinate
frame changes. Each wheel has a coordinate frame that tracks how it is
rotating, and where it is. Generally, anything on the robot that is not
fixed in space, will have a tf describing it. In the **rqt_graph
section**, you can see that the **/tf topic** is published to and
subscribed from by many different nodes.

One intuitive way to see how the tf topic is structured for a robot is
to use the **view_frames** tool provided by ROS. Open a terminal window.
Type in:

```
rosrun tf view_frames
```

Wait for this to complete, and then type in:

```
evince frames.pdf
```

This will bring up something similar to the following image.

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/tfframes.png)

Here we can see that all four wheel are referenced to the **base_link**.
We also see that the **odom topic** is driving the reference of the
whole robot. This means that if you write to the **odom topic** (IE,
when you publish to the **/cmd_vel topic**) then the whole robot will
move.

Udev is a device manager for Linux that dynamically creates and removes
nodes for hardware devices. In short, it helps your computer find your
robot easily. By default, hardware devices attached to your Linux
(Ubuntu) PC will belong to the root user. This means that any programs
(e.g. ROS nodes) running as an unprivileged (i.e. not root) user will
not be able to access them. On top of that, devices will receive names
such as ttyACMx and ttyUSBx arbitrarily based on the order in which they
were plugged in. Luckily, you can solve this, and more, with **udev
rules**.

You probably already have at least one udev rule on your system that
solves the naming problem for network devices, and you can take a peek
at it in the **/etc/udev/rules.d/** folder -- it's probably named
**70-persistent-net.rules**.

Some driver/software packages will already provide udev rules you can
use. Check the **/etc/udev/rules.d/** folder to see if there's anything
installed already. If the package is lazy and gives you a udev rule to
install yourself, you can do this using:

```
sudo cp <rule file> /etc/udev/rules.d/>
```

## Writing a new udev rule:

If you still need to write your own rule to setup naming and permissions
for your device, read on. Rules can get extremely complex, but the below
should cover 99% of use cases for ROS applications. If you're looking
for 99.9%, I suggest you [start
here](http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html). As an
example, we will examine the udev rule provided by the urg_node driver
in ROS:

``` bash
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="15d1", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0000", MODE="666", PROGRAM="/opt/ros/noetic/lib/urg_node/getID /dev/%k q", SYMLINK+="sensors/hokuyo_%c", GROUP="dialout"
```

A udev rule is made up of a bunch of comma separated tags, as above. The
tags are divided into two parts: matching and configuration, however
they can be written into the rule in any order (confusingly enough).

## Matching:

The matching part lets the udev device manager match the rule to the
device you want. The manager will try to match all new devices as they
get plugged in, so it's important that the rule be specific enough to
capture only the device you're looking for, otherwise you'll end up with
a /dev/hokuyo symlink to an IMU. There are many potential matching tags,
and the best way to pick the useful ones is to get all the device
attributes straight from udev.

Run the following command, inserting a **<devpath\>** such as
**/dev/ttyACM0**:

```
udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n <devpath>)
```

You will get a list of all device attributes visible to udev. looking at
device [/dev/ttyACM0]{.title-ref}

``` bash
KERNEL=="ttyACM0"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty"
DRIVER==""
looking at parent device '...':
KERNELS=="3-3:1.0"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb"
DRIVERS=="cdc_acm"
ATTRS{bInterfaceClass}=="02"
ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="00"
looking at parent device '...':
...
ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483"
ATTRS{idProduct}=="5740"
...
```

Each of the device attributes is a potential tag. You can use any of the
tags in the first section to filter, along with tags from a parent
device. Use regex to make matching more flexible (e.g. \[0-9\] to match
any number, \* to match anything at all). Example:

``` bash
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5740", ...
```

Due to the way udev is designed, you can only pull in the tags from one
parent device. So in the above example you can always use the KERNEL and
theSUBSYSTEM tag in your udev rule, but you cannot use both DRIVERS
andATTRS{idVendor} to do matching. Usually this is not a problem, since
idVendor and idProduct are always present, and identify the majority of
device types uniquely.

You should also add the ACTION tag, which is usually "add", sometimes
"remove" if you want to do something when the device is unplugged.

``` bash
..., ACTION=="add", ...
```

## Configuration:

Now that you have a rule that matches the device you want, you can add
several configuration tags:

| Tag                               | Usage |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MODE="0666"                       | Set permissions to allow any user read/write access to the device. |
| SYMLINK+="hokuyo"                 | Create a symlink in /dev/ for this device. |
| RUN+="/bin/echo 'hello world'""   | Execute an arbitrary command. [For advanced usage](http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html#external-run) |

It is good practice to make sure symlinks are unique for each device, so
the above is actually poor practice! If you have multiple devices of the
same type (e.g. 2 Hokuyos), or if you have multiple devices using a
generic USB-to-Serial converter (e.g. FTDI), a basic idVendor and
idProduct rule will not properly discriminate between these devices,
since udev will map all matching devices to the same symlink. There are
several approaches:

**1. Directly through device attributes:**

If your device has a unique identifier, such as a serial number, encoded
in its attributes, you can painlessly create a unique symlink for each
device:

``` bash
..., SYMLINK+=”device_$attr{serial}”, ...
```

The manufacturer will not always make it this easy for you. If a parent
device has a serial number, you can use the following trick using
environment variables.Create a udev rule for the parent device to store
an environment variable:

``` bash
..., <match parent device>..., ENV{SERIAL_NUMBER}="$attr{serial_number}"
```

And a rule for the child device that uses the variable in the symlink:

``` bash
..., <match child device>..., SYMLINK+="device_$env{SERIAL_NUMBER}"
```

**2. Through an external program:**

If the manufacturer does not expose a unique identifier through the
device attributes at all, you could execute an external command using
the PROGRAM tag:

``` bash
PROGRAM="/bin/device_namer %k", SYMLINK+="%c"
```

Unlike the RUN tag which spins off, this command will block (needs to be
executed before the rule is fully processed), so it must return quickly.
Theurg_node driver above uses this tag to execute a ROS binary:

``` bash
PROGRAM="/opt/ros/noetic/lib/urg_node/getID /dev/%k q", SYMLINK+="sensors/hokuyo_%c"
```

Substitution argument %k refers to the device path relative to /dev/,
and %crefers to the output of the PROGRAM tag.

**Running a new udev rule:**

Once you have copied (sudo cp) your rule into the /etc/udev/rules.d/
folder, you can test it with your device. To get udev to recognize your
rule, run the following command:

```
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo service udev restart && sudo udevadm trigger
```

You should be able to find a symlink in /dev/ that links to the full
device path (e.g./dev/ttyACM0), and the permissions on the device path
should be read/write for all users. If your permissions aren't being
set, and you symlink is not being created in /dev/ as expected, you can
try simulating udev's processing of the rule by running the following
with the appropriate device path:

```
udevadm test $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/ttyACM0)
```

## Things to keep in mind

-   Check that your rule follows the naming convention --
    <priority\>-<device name\>.rules. Technically you can have
    multiple rules for the same device, and the number determines what
    order they'd get executed in. Since we're writing addon rules, a
    priority of 99 is safest.
-   You can have multiple rules in a file separated by newlines. Make
    sure that each individual rule is on one line.
-   Check that all tags (matching and configuration) are comma
    separated.
-   Check that your rule file has a trailing newline.
-   Check that your rule is owned by the root user -- ll
    /etc/udev/rules.d/should say 'root root' for the rule file.

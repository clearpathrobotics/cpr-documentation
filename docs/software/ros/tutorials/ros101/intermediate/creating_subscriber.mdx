We previously learned how to write a publisher node to move Husky
randomly. BUT! What good is publishing all these messages if no one is
there to read it? In this tutorial we'll write a subscriber that reads
Husky's position from the odom topic, and graph its movements. Instead
of just copy-pasting code into a text file, we'll pull the required
packages from GitHub, a very common practice among developers.

Before we begin, install Git to pull packages from GitHub, and pygame,
to provide us with the tools to map out Husky's movements:

```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

## Pulling from GitHub

GitHub is a popular tool among developers due to its use of version
control - most ROS software has an associated GitHub repository. Users
are able to "pull" files from the GitHub servers, make changes, then
"push" these changes back to the server. In this tutorial we will be
using GitHub to pull the ROS packages that we'll be using. The first
step is to make a new directory to pull the packages:

```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src/ros101
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ros101
git init
```

Since we now know the URL that hosts the repositories, we'll easily be
able to pull the packages from GitHub. Access the repositories using the
following command:

```
git pull https://github.com/mcoteCPR/ROS101.git
```

That's it! You should see an src and launch folder, as well as a
**CMakelist.txt** and **package.xml** in your ros101 folder. You now
have the package **ros101** which includes the nodes
**random_driver.cpp** and **odom_graph.py**.

## Writing the Subscriber

We've already gone through the random_driver C++ code in the last
tutorial, so this time we'll go over the python code for
**odom_graph.py**. This node uses the Pygame library to track Husky's
movement. Pygame is a set of modules intended to create video games in
python; however, we'll focus on the ROS portion of this code. More
information on Pygame can be found [on their
website](http://www.pygame.org/) . The code for the **odom_graph** node
can be found at:

```
gedit ~/catkin_ws/src/ros101/src/odom_graph.py
```

Let's take a look at this code line by line:

```
import rospy
from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry
```

Much like the C++ publisher code, this includes the rospy library and
imports the Odometry message type from **nav_msgs.msg**. To learn more
about a specific message type, you can visit <http://docs.ros.org> to
see it's definition, for example, we are using
<http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html> . The next
block of code imports the pygame libraries and sets up the initial
conditions for our display.

```
def odomCB(msg)
```

This is the odometry call back function, which is called every time our
subscriber receives a message. The content of this function simply draws
a line on our display between the last coordinates read from the
odometry position message. This function will continually be called in
our main loop.

```
def listener():
```

The following line starts the ROS node, **anonymous=True** means
multiples of the same node can run at the same time:

```
rospy.init_node('odom_graph', anonymous=True)
```

Subscriber sets up the node to read messages from the "odom" topic,
which are of the type Odometry, and calls the **odomCB** functions when
it receives a message:

```
rospy.Subscriber("odom", Odometry, odomCB)
```

The last line of this function keeps the node active until it's shut
down:

```
rospy.spin()
```

## Putting it All Together

Now it's time to test it out! Go ahead and close the **odom_graph.py**
file and build your workspace using the catkin_make function in your
workspace directory.

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```

The next step is to launch our Husky simulation to start up ROS and all
the Husky related nodes.

```
roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_empty_world.launch
```

In this tutorial we have provided a launch file that will start the
random_driver and **odom_graph** node. The launch file is located in
**\~/ros101/src/launch** and is called **odom_graph_test.launch**. If
you want to learn more about launch files, check out our launch file
article on our support knowledge base. We will now source our workspace
and launch both nodes with the launch file in a new terminal window.

```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ros101 odom_graph_test.launch
```

There you have it! Our subscriber is now listening to messages on the
odom topic, and graphing out Husky's path.

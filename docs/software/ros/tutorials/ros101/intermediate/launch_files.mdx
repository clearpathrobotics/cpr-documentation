Launch files are very common in ROS to both users and developers. They
provide a convenient way to start up multiple nodes and a master, as
well as other initialization requirements such as setting parameters.

## ROSLAUNCH

**roslaunch** is used to open launch files. This can be done by either
specifying the package the launch files are contained in followed by the
name of the launch file, or by specifying the file path to the launch
file.

```
roslaunch <package> <launch_file>
roslaunch </PATH/TO/LAUNCH_FILE/launch_file>
```

Note: roslaunch will also start roscore if no master has been set.
Pushing Ctrl-C in a terminal with a launch file running will close all
nodes that were started with that launch files.

## Writing a .launch File

Launch files are of the format .launch and use a specific XML format.
They can be placed anywhere within a package directory, but it is common
to make a directory named "Launch" inside the workspace directory to
organize all your launch files. The contents of a launch file must be
contained between a pair of launch tags

```
<launch>
    ...
</launch>
```

To actually start a node, the <node\> tags are used, the pkg, type and
name argument are required.

```
<node pkg="..." type="..." name="..." respawn=true ns="..."/>
```

**pkg/type/name:** The argument pkg points to the package associated
with the node that is to be launched, while "type" refers to the name
of the node executable file. It is also possible to overwrite the name
of the node with the name argument, this will take priority over the
name that is given to the node in the code.

**Respawn/Required:** However optional, it's common to either have a
respawn argument or a required argument, but not both. If respawn=true,
then this particular node will be restarted if for some reason it
closed. Required=true will do the opposite, that is, it will shut down
all the nodes associated with a launch file if this particular node
comes down. There are other optional argument available on the [ROS
wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/node).

**ns:** Another common use for a launch file is to launch a node inside
a namespace. This is useful when using multiple instances of the same
node. You can specify a namespace by using the "ns" argument.

**arg:** Sometimes it is necessary to use a local variable in launch
files. This can be done using

```
<arg name="..." value="...">
```

Now let's take a look at the launch file we use on our Husky's
on-board PC on startup to get things going.

```
<launch>
    <arg name="port" default="$(optenv HUSKY_PORT /dev/prolific)" />

    <node pkg="clearpath_base" type="kinematic_node" name="husky_kinematic" ns="husky">
        <param name="port" value="$(arg port)" />
        <rosparam>
            cmd_fill: True
                data:
                    system_status: 10
                    safety_status: 10
                    encoders: 10
                differential_speed: 10
                differential_output: 10
                power_status: 1
                </rosparam>
            </node>

    <!-- Publish diagnostics information from low-level MCU outputs -->
    <node pkg="husky_base" name="husky_base_diagnostics" type="diagnostics_publisher" />

    <!-- Publish wheel odometry from MCU encoder data -->
    <node pkg="husky_base" name="husky_basic_odom" type="basic_odom_publisher" />

    <!-- Diagnostic Aggregator -->

    <node pkg="diagnostic_aggregator" type="aggregator_node" name="diagnostic_aggregator">
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find husky_base)/config/diagnostics.yaml"/>
    </node>
</launch>
```

The first thing to notice is the <launch\> tags which are required for
all launch files. The next line finds what port Husky is connected to,
and saves it to an argument named "port". The node "kinematic_node"
from the package"clearpath_base" is then started in the "husky" name
space.

Parameters within the <node\> tags are private to that namepace. The
"port" argument that was defined earlier is set to the port parameter.
Several other parameters are populated using the YAML format with
<parameter\> tags.

Along with the kinematic_node node, this launch file also starts
husky_base_diagnositcs and husky_base_odom. You can see that the
parameters for the diagnostics_aggregator node are loaded from a YAML
file.

This should cover most of what you will need to write your own launch
files, but for more information on launch files visit the [ROS
wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/node).

If you've worked with ROS and robotics, you've probably heard of
gmaping, localization, SLAM, costmaps and paths, but what does all this
mean? They are more than just robot buzz words; these allow a robot to
get from one point to another without bumping into obstacles, and in
this tutorial, we'll be covering some of the key concepts in what makes
up an autonomous robot.

For this tutorial, we'll be using Clearpath's Jackal simulation in ROS
Noetic. If you've never used ROS before, or don't have ROS Noetic
installed on your machine, check out the [ROS
wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/i%20%20ndigo) to get started.

## Getting Started

We'll begin by installing Clearpath's Jackal simulation, desktop, and
navigation packages.

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-jackal-simulator ros-noetic-jackal-desktop
```

In addition, we'll need the Jackal navigation package, but instead of
installing the debians packages with apt-get, we'll create a sourced
workspace so we can make changes to some of these files and see how it
effects our simulation. For a full explanation on creating and compiling
a sourced workspace, check out our [Creating a Workspace and
Package](http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/guides/ros/Creating%20publisher.html)
tutorial, but for the purpose of this tutorial, here is a series of
commands that'll clone the jackal_navigation package (and a few others)
into a sourced workspace.

```
cd ~
mkdir -p jackal_navigation/src
cd jackal_navigation/src && catkin_init_workspace
git clone https://github.com/jackal/jackal.git
git clone https://github.com/jackal/jackal_simulator.git
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/LMS1xx.git
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/pointgrey_camera_driver.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

The **Jackal_navigation** package simply contains configuration files in
the params directory, and launch files to load these parameters and
launch certain packages in the ROS navigation stack. The navigation
stack is where the real magic happens when it comes to navigating with a
ROS robot. Let's begin by launching our Jackal simulation with a
simulated laser.

```
source ~/jackal_navigation/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch jackal_gazebo jackal_world.launch config:=front_laser
```

When you can't use a real Jackal, Gazebo is the next best thing! This
simulation provides us with odometry and scan data, which is all we need
to get Jackal driving around on it's own! **In a new terminal**, source
your jackal_navigation workspace and launch odom_navigation_demo.launch.

```
source ~/jackal_navigation/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch jackal_navigation odom_navigation_demo.launch
```

This launch file launches the [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base)
package. **move_base** allows Jackal to try to reach a goal simply with
laser and odometry data.

We'll begin our navigation tutorial by first building a map of our
Gazebo world using the **gmapping.launch** file in the Jackal navigation
package **in another terminal**, remember to source your workspace!

```
source ~/jackal_navigation/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch jackal_navigation gmapping.launch
```

If you're familiar with ROS launch files, I'd encourage you to take a
look [at
gmapping](https://github.com/jackal/jackal/blob/noetic-devel/jackal_navigation/launch/include/gmapping.launch),
otherwise, you can check out our tutorial on [launch
files](http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/guides/ros/Launch%20Files.html).
This launch file is simply starting the [gmaping
package](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping) and setting several of the
gmapping parameters which are described on the [gmapping ROS
wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping) page. **In a new terminal**, open up
Rviz using the Jackal's gmaping configuration.

```
source ~/jackal_navigation/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch jackal_viz view_robot.launch config:=gmapping
```

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/gmappingconfig.png)

Take a look around and get familiar with all the different displays on
the left side of the window. Notice there are two maps. One is
visualizing the **/map** topic, which is what is being built from the
gmapping demo as the robot moves around. If you click the check box
beside the other map, you can now see the costmap from
**/move_base/global_costmap/costmap**. The costmap is responsible for
the inflation around obstacles to account for the footprint of the
robot; the larger the inflation radius, the further the robot will keep
away from these obstacles.

Before we start mapping, let's add another view to our Rviz
visualization. Click **Add** in the bottom left, and look for
**/move_base/NavfnROS/plan** and click **Path**. This lets us see what
Jackal is thinking! It'll show you the path Jackal is going to attempt
to use to reach its goal, and you'll be able to see it change in real
time.

## Mapping

Now it's time to start mapping! Using the tool bar on the top of the
Rviz window, send 2D Nav Goals to Jackal. As it drives around, more of
the map will be discovered. Also notice the path and how it changes as
Jackal finds obstacles.

## Localization

Once you're happy with the map you've made, go ahead and save it using

```
rosrun map_server map_saver -f jackal_world
```

This will create a map file in your current directory called
**jackal_world**, which we will use in our
[AMCL](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) demo. Go ahead and terminate all of the
ROS terminals using CTRL-C. Then launch the simulator once again, the
AMCL demo with the map we just created, and Rviz with our localization
config, **all in separate terminals**. If you closed the windows,
you'll need to source your terminals again.

When launching the AMCL demo below (second line of code), be sure to
include the absolute path to jackal_world.yaml.

```
roslaunch jackal_gazebo jackal_world.launch config:=front_laser
roslaunch jackal_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=<ABSOLUTE_PATH>/jackal_world.yaml
roslaunch jackal_viz view_robot.launch config:=localization
```

For the purpose of this demonstration, I recommend hiding the Robot
Model and Axes, and showing the Pose Array using the check boxes on the
side. The red arrows around Jackal are the poses Jackal could be, based
on a Monte Carlo localization estimate. This takes in scan data and
transforms, and evaluates that data against the map we recorded
previously to try to determine where it is within the Jackal world.

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/jackalposearray.png)

If you give Jackal a 2D nav goal, you can see how the pose array gets
much more refined, as the system takes in more information about its
surrounding, and rules out possible poses.

![image](/img/software_images/ros/tutorials/ros101/smallposearray.png)

Another important tool is the 2D pose estimate. You can assist Jackal in
localization by giving it a rough idea of where it should be in the map.
You'll notice that the pose array will get populated in the general
area of a 2D pose estimate, and once again gets refined as it eliminates
poses.

## Customization

Now that's we've covered some of the basics, let's bring in a fully
loaded Jackal to play with.

There is a **custom_example.urdf** file in the urdf folder. I'd
encourage you to check out this file for yourself, and see if you can
tell what sensors are being added to Jackal and where!

Once you're ready to actually launch this suped-up Jackal, set the
**JACKAL_URDF_EXTRAS** parameter to the file path to this
**custome_example.urdf** file.

```
export JACKAL_URDF_EXTRAS=~/jackal_navigation/src/jackal/jackal_description/urdf/custom_example.urdf
```

From there, source your terminal and simply launch the Jackal simulation
as you normally would.

```
source ~/jackal_navigation/devel/setup.bash
roslauch jackal_gazebo jackal_world.launch
```

You should now see a fully loaded Jackal! There are 2 bumblebee cameras
angled downwards on the front and the back, 2 LIDARS scanning forwards
and backwards, and there is a pointgrey camera giving us an image
directly in front of Jackal.

From here, you can open up any of the demos we used earlier, or go
straight into Rviz to visualize our new sensors.

```
roslauch jackal_viz view_robot.launch
```

At this point, I invite you to play around with these new sensors and
try adding them into Rviz so you can see the different images from the
cameras.

If you really want to get adventurous, try changing some of the
navigation parameters in the **jackal_navigation** launch files. You
could also try mapping different Gazebo worlds using the many that are
available online, or even making your own!

This tutorial merely scratched the surface of the ROS navigation
packages, but I hope this helped you understand some of the basics
concepts, and get you started exploring ROS navigation for yourself!

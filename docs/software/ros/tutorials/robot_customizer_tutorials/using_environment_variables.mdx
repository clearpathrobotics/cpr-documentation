## Setting Environment Variables

Once you have completed the previous tutorial sections, you are now
ready to use the environment variables interface provided by the Robot
Customizer ROS package!

The complete list of supported sensors and environment variables can be
found at [Supported Sensors and Environment Variables](/docs/software/ros/tutorials/robot_customizer_tutorials/overview#supported-sensor-envars).

In this section of the tutorial, we will go through an example usage of
the environment variables interface for a SICK LMS1xx 2D laser scanner.

1.  Enable the SICK LMS1xx 2D laser scanner. In terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    export CPR_LASER=1
    export CPR_LASER_MODEL=lms1xx
    ```

2.  Choose a link in your robot model (defined in your robot's
    `.urdf.xacro` file) to mount the SICK LMS1xx 2D laser scanner. Feel
    free to adjust the XYZ and RPY coordinates of the SICK LMS1xx 2D
    laser scanner relative to the chosen link. For example, we will
    mount it on the `box` link in the `generic_robot.urdf.xacro` file,
    offset slightly in the negative x and positive z directions. In
    terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    export CPR_LASER_PARENT=box
    export CPR_LASER_XYZ="-0.1 0 0.12"
    export CPR_LASER_RPY="0 0 0"
    ```

3.  Choose a ROS topic that the driver launch file will publish 2D laser
    scan data to. For example, we will choose to have the 2D laser scan
    data published to the `/scan` ROS topic. In terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    export CPR_LASER_TOPIC=scan
    ```

4.  Choose the IP address assigned to the SICK LMS1xx 2D laser scanner.
    This will let the driver launch file know where to detect it, and
    allow it to start retrieving 2D laser scan data. From factory, the
    IP address of the SICK LMS1xx 2D laser scanner is set to
    `192.168.0.10`. In terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    export CPR_LASER_IP=192.168.0.10
    ```

5.  At this point, you can try launching your robot's `.launch` file.
    The `description.launch` file used in generic robot example will be
    used for this tutorial. In terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    roslaunch cpr_robot_customizer description.launch
    ```

6.  If your SICK LMS1xx 2D laser scanner is connected to your robot's
    computer and with the IP address configured correctly, then
    launching the `.launch` file should automatically launch the SICK
    LMS1xx 2D laser scanner's driver. You can verify this by checking
    the output in your terminal, and also by checking the 2D laser scan
    data currently being published in ROS. In terminal, run:

    ``` bash
    rostopic echo /scan
    ```

    The state of your robot (based on your robot's model) will also be
    published to ROS; however, you currently will not be able to visually
    verify this. Please see the [next section](#visualizing) to learn how
    to visualize your robot's model, the sensors attached to it, and the
    sensors' data in `rviz`.

7.  The environment variables set in steps 1. to 4. will only be set in
    that terminal session, meaning upon closing that terminal session,
    those environment variables will be unset! In order to keep the
    desired values of environment variables persistent, you can simply
    add the `export ENVAR=VALUE` lines to your robot's `~/.bashrc`
    file; this way, those environment variables will be set upon booting
    the robot's computer, and will remain persistent in any terminal
    session.

## Visualizing with Rviz   {#visualizing}

After setting up your robot and adding the sensors you want, you can now
visualize your robot's updated model in `rviz`. In addition, if you
have the physical sensors and included the launching of their drivers,
you can also visualize your sensors' data.

The Robot Customizer ROS package provides a useful `.launch` file for
visualization in `rviz`. This file is called `rviz.launch`, and can be
found
[here](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_robot_customizer/blob/noetic-devel/launch/rviz.launch).

To use it, simply launch `rviz.launch` and provide the
`description_launch` argument with the path to your robot's `.launch`
file. For example, you can visualize the model of the example
`generic_robot.urdf.xacro` robot along with the SICK LMS1xx 2D laser
scanner attached to it. In terminal, run:

``` bash
roslaunch cpr_robot_customizer rviz.launch description_launch:=/home/administrator/catkin_ws/src/cpr_robot_customizer/example/description.launch
```

Once `rviz` loads, you should see the model of the example generic
robot, along with the SICK LMS1xx 2D laser scanner mounted ontop of the
`box` link.

In addition, if you have the physical sensor setup, you can also add the
`/scan` ROS topic to `rviz` to see the 2D laser scans from the SICK
LMS1xx 2D laser scanner.

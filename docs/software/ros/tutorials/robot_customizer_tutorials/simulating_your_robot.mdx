## Simulating with Gazebo

If you do not have a physical robot and physical sensors, you can
instead simulate everything using `gazebo`.

The Robot Customizer ROS package provides a useful `.launch` file for
simulation in `gazebo`. This file is called `gazebo.launch`, and can be
found
[here](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_robot_customizer/blob/noetic-devel/launch/gazebo.launch).

To use it, simply launch `gazebo.launch` and provide the
`description_launch` argument with the path to your robot's `.launch`
file. For example, you can simulate the model of the example
`generic_robot.urdf.xacro` robot along with the SICK LMS1xx 2D laser
scanner attached to it. In terminal, run:

``` bash
roslaunch cpr_robot_customizer gazebo.launch description_launch:=/home/administrator/catkin_ws/src/cpr_robot_customizer/example/description.launch
```

Once `gazebo` loads, you should see the model of the example generic
robot, along with the SICK LMS1xx 2D laser scanner mounted ontop of the
`box` link.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Robot Customizer ROS package, there are a few
prerequisites that must be met. The prerequisites are different
depending on your intended use case, all of which are detailed below.

### Real Robot and Sensors

If you have a physical robot and physical sensors:

:::note

The sensors you have must be on the [list of supported sensors](/docs/software/ros/tutorials/robot_customizer_tutorials/overview#supported-sensor-envars).

:::

1.  Your robot's computer is running Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) with ROS
    Noetic.
2.  You have electromechanically integrated (e.g. mounted and wired) the
    sensors onto your robot.

### Simulated Robot and Sensors

If you do not have a physical robot and physical sensors, and instead
wish to simulate them:

1.  Your computer is running Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) with ROS Noetic.

## Installing

There are two ways to install the Robot Customizer ROS package on your
robot's computer and/or on your computer, both of which are covered in
this section.

### Installing the Debian Package

**Add Clearpath Debian Package Repository**

Before you can install the Robot Customizer ROS package, you need to
configure Ubuntu's APT package manager to add Clearpath's package
server:

1.  Install the authentication key for the
    `packages.clearpathrobotics.com` repository. In terminal, run:

    ```bash
    wget https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

2.  Add the debian sources for the repository. In terminal, run:

    ```bash
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clearpath-latest.list'
    ```

3.  Update the computer's package cache. In terminal, run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

**Installing Debian Package**

1.  You should now be able to install the Robot Customizer ROS package.
    In terminal, run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-cpr-robot-customizer
    ```

### Installing from Source

The Robot Customizer ROS package is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_robot_customizer), and
can be compiled and installed from source if desired:

1.  Create a workspace directory. In terminal, run:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    ```

2.  Clone the Robot Customizer repository into your workspace directory.
    In terminal, run:

    ```bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws_ws/src
    git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_robot_customizer
    cd ..
    ```

3.  Install additional dependencies. In terminal, run:

    ```bash
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=$ROS_DISTRO -r -y
    ```

4.  Build the workspace. In terminal, run:

    ```bash
    catkin_make
    ```

5.  You can now source your workspace to make use of the Robot
    Customizer ROS package you just built. In terminal, run:

    ```bash
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```

## Setting Up Your Robot's Model

One of the features of the Robot Customizer ROS package is automatically
adding models of sensors onto your robot's model.

To use this feature, you will need to build your robot's model, include
the Robot Customizer ROS package's sensor models in your robot's
model, and broadcast your robot's updated model in ROS.

### URDF

1.  Create a `.urdf.xacro` file that describes your robot's model.

    :::note

    A `.urdf.xacro` file serves the same purpose as a regular `.urdf` file;
    that is, describing a robot's model through URDF. However, a
    `.urdf.xacro` file also enables the usage of `xacro` macros.

    :::

    :::note

    If you are unfamiliar with what URDF is, how URDF works, and/or how to
    use `xacro` to improve a `.urdf` file, check out [this tutorial on the
    ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials).

    :::

    For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using the example
    `generic_robot.urdf.xacro` file which can be found
    [here](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_robot_customizer/blob/noetic-devel/example/generic_robot.urdf.xacro).
    Upon closer inspection, you will notice that this file simply creates
    the links and joints for a generic robot. This file also leverages
    `xacro` to reuse properties, create macros, and most importantly,
    include other `.urdf.xacro` files!

2.  Scroll to the bottom of the example `generic_robot.urdf.xacro` file
    and notice the following line responsible for including the Robot
    Customizer ROS package's sensor models:

    ```bash
    <xacro:include filename="$(find cpr_robot_customizer)/urdf/accessories.urdf.xacro" />
    ```

3.  Add the line in step 2. to the bottom of your robot's `.urdf.xacro`
    file.

### Launch   {#robot-model-launch}

1.  Create a `.launch` file that loads your robot's `.urdf.xacro` file
    into the `robot_description` parameter, and launches
    `robot_state_publisher` to broadcast your robot's `tf` transforms
    to ROS. If your robot has any non-fixed joints (e.g. wheels), your
    `.launch` file will also need to launch the `joint_state_publisher`
    to broadcast your robot's joints information.

    :::note

    If you are unfamiliar with using `robot_state_publisher` to broadcast a
    robot's model from a `.launch` file, check out
    [this tutorial on the ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/robot_state_publisher/Tutorials/Using%20the%20robot%20state%20publisher%20on%20your%20own%20robot).

    :::

    For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using the example
    `description.launch` file which can be found
    [here](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_robot_customizer/blob/noetic-devel/example/description.launch).
    Upon closer inspection, you will notice that this file simply loads the
    `generic_robot.urdf.xacro` file into the `robot_description` parameter,
    and launches both `robot_state_publisher` and `joint_state_publisher`.

2.  Scroll to the bottom of the example `description.launch` file and
    notice the following line responsible for including the Robot
    Customizer ROS package's sensor driver launch files:

    ```bash
    <include file="$(find cpr_robot_customizer)/launch/accessories.launch"/>
    ```

3.  **DO NOT** add the line in step 2. to the bottom of your robot's
    `.launch` file yet! Please continue to [Sensor Drivers](#sensor-drivers) to
    learn how to include the sensors' drivers launch files to your
    robot.

## Including Sensor Driver Launch Files   {#sensor-drivers}

One of the features of the Robot Customizer ROS package is automatically
launching the drivers launch files of the sensors attached to your
robot.

:::note

You will only be able to use this feature if you have the physical
sensors electromechnically integrated onto your physical robot! You will
not be able to launch the sensors' drivers otherwise (e.g. if you are
simulating your robot and the sensors).

:::

1.  Continuing from the [previous section](#robot-model-launch), add
    the following line to the bottom of your robot's `.launch` file:

    ``` bash
    <include file="$(find cpr_robot_customizer)/launch/accessories.launch"/>
    ```

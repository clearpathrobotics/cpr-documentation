The OutdoorNav Starter Kit is a low-cost hardware bundle that allows you to begin autonomous outdoor navigation using
Clearpath's [OutdoorNav Autonomy Software](/docs/software/navigation_packages#outdoornav-autonomy-software). It integrates
easily onto Husky and Jackal, but is compatible with third-party robots as outlined below.

TODO: Stephen Sharp to provide PACS kits for individual components (as some components can be mounted separately for third-party integrations).
TODO: Stephen Sharp to provide part numbers for Husky 100mm cable and Jackal 100mm cable.

## Mechanical Mounting

The OutdoorNav Starter Kit can be mounted directly using either its 80 X 80 mm or 120 X 120 mm hole pattern using M5 flathead screws.

TODO: Stephen Sharp to create drawing

On Jackal, mount the kit using the standard 80 X 80 hole pattern at the front of Jackal.

On Husky, mount the kit on the leading edge of the top plate. Where a PACS-compatible top plate exists, the kit can be mounted directly.
When using an older Husky without a PACS-compatible top plate, it will be necessary to drill your own holes.

## Electrical Integration

The OutdoorNav Starter Kit includes a 1 m cable for generic integrations. Adapter cables are then used for robot-specific integrations.

- For electrical integration on Husky, purchase the OutdoorNav Starter Kit Husky Adapter Cable, as listed in [Item Numbers](#item-numbers).
- For electrical integration on Jackal, purchase the OutdoorNav Starter Kit Jackal Adapter Cable, as listed in [Item Numbers](#item-numbers).
- For electrical integration on third-party robot, an adapter cable will need to be created. Refer to the pinout below.

TODO: Stephen Sharp to provide pinout information for the end of the 1m cable; include voltage/current ratings

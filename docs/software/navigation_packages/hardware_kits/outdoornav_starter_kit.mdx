The OutdoorNav Starter Kit is a low-cost hardware bundle that allows you to begin autonomous outdoor navigation using
Clearpath's [OutdoorNav Autonomy Software](/docs/software/navigation_packages#outdoornav-autonomy-software). It integrates
easily onto Husky and Jackal, but is compatible with third-party robots as outlined below.

On Jackal, mount the kit using the standard 120 X 120 hole pattern at the front of Jackal.

On Husky, mount the kit on the leading edge of the top plate. Where a PACS-compatible top plate exists, the kit can be mounted directly.
When using an older Husky without a PACS-compatible top plate, it will be necessary to drill your own holes.

## Electrical Integration

### Power Integration

The OutdoorNav Starter Kit includes a 1 m IP67 power cable to provide power from the base platform to the Starter Kit.
Adapter cables can be used for robot-specific integrations.

- For power integration on Husky, purchase the OutdoorNav Starter Kit Husky Adapter Cable, as listed in [Item Numbers](#item-numbers).
- For power integration on Jackal, purchase the OutdoorNav Starter Kit Jackal Adapter Cable, as listed in [Item Numbers](#item-numbers).
- For power integration on a third-party robot, an adapter cable will need to be created.

  - The provided 1 m power cable is terminated with a Molex Mini-Fit Jr connector (Molex 0039012025).
  - The adapter cable should use the appropriate mating connector (Molex 0039013029).
  - The pinout is illustrated in the figure below:

    - Pin 1: VIN (18 to 75 VDC, 7 A max)
    - Pin 2: GND

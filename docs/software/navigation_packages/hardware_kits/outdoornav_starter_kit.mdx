TODO: top-level image

The OutdoorNav Starter Kit is a low-cost hardware bundles that allows you to begin autonomous outdoor navigation using
Clearpath's [OutdoorNav Autonomy Software](/docs/software/navigation_packages#outdoornav-autonomy-software). It integrates
easily onto Husky and Jackal, but is compatible with third-party robots as outlined below.

TODO: Stephen Sharp to provide PACS kits for individual components (as some components can be mounted separately for third-party integrations).
TODO: Stephen Sharp to provide part numbers for Husky 100mm cable and Jackal 100mm cable.

## Mechanical Mounting

The OutdoorNav Starter Kit can be mounted directly using either its 80 X 80 mm or 120 X 120 mm hole pattern using M5 flathead screws.

TODO: Stephen Sharp to create drawing

On Jackal, mount the kit using the standard 80 X 80 hole pattern at the front of Jackal.

On Husky, the kit should be mounted on the leading edge of the top plate. Where a PACS-compatible top plate exists, the kit can be mounted directly.
When using an older Husky without a PACS-compatible top plate, it will be necessary to drill your own holes.

## Electrical Integration

The OutdoorNav Starter Kit includes a 1 m cable for generic integrations. Adapter cables are then used for robot-specific integrations.

- For electrical integration on Husky, purchase the OutdoorNav Starter Kit Husky Adapter Cable, as listed in [Item Numbers](#item-numbers).
- For electrical integration on Jackal, purchase the OutdoorNav Starter Kit Jackal Adapter Cable, as listed in [Item Numbers](#item-numbers).
- For electrical integration on third-party robot, an adapter cable will need to be created. Refer to the pinout below.

TODO: Stephen Sharp to provide pinout information for the end of the 1m cable; include voltage/current ratings

## Software Integration

The required software for the OutdoorNav Starter Kit is pre-installed. However, existing robot computer must be configured as outlined below
to operate properly with the OutdoorNav Starter Kit.

### Base Robot Software Configuration

The following configuration must be applied to your base robot's computer.

- Connect an ethernet cable between the base robot computer and the OutdoorNavStarter Kit, either directly between them or via an ethernet switch.
  Make note of which port was used on the base robot computer so that it's IP address can be configured in the next step.
- Ensure network connectivity between the base robot computer and the OutdoorNav Starter Kit on the `192.168.131.XXX` subnet.
  Configure the base robot computer to have a static IP assigned on the interface that is used to connect to the OutdoorNav Starter Kit.
  Ideally this IP address will be `192.168.131.1`, but it can be in the `192.168.131.1-4` range. In some cases, this may require the
  creation of a virtual interface.
- On the base robot computer, add the following line to the `/etc/hosts` file.
  ```
  192.168.131.5     cpr-outdoornav
  ```
- Install ROS Noetic (the base version is sufficient).

### Base Robot Software Validation Checks

The following checks must be successful for the OutdoorNav Autonomy Software to operate properly:

- The OutdoorNav Starter Kit can be pinged at `192.168.131.5` from the base robot computer.
- ROS Noetic is running on the base robot computer withwith the `ROS_MASTER_URI` set to the base platform computer.
  Note that `localhost` is acceptable only if the primary subnet on the base robot computer is the `192.168.131.XXX` subnet.
- All ROS topics listed in the [Interface Control Checklist](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/integration_requirements/interface_control_requirements)
  are publishing as expected on the base robot computer.

Once communication has been set up and both the base robot computer and OutdoorNav Starter Kit have been restarted:

- Run `rostopic list` on the base robot computer and confirm that it includes the OutdoorNav topics.
- On the base robot computer, ensure that you are able to echo the `/control_selection/control_state` topic.

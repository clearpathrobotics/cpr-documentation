Clearpath Robotics is committed to the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) and the community of researchers
and users that support it. Each robot that Clearpath deploys is designed to be used with this open
source platform. The extensibility of ROS has also allowed Clearpath to use it to develop proprietary
autonomy software for indoor and outdoor use.

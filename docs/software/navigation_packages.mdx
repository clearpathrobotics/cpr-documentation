Open source navigation packages are described in detail in the robot-specific
tutorials (eg. [Navigating Husky](http://localhost:3000/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/husky/tutorials_husky#navigating-husky)).
If your use case requires a more advanced level of autonomy, Clearpath also offers advanced navigation software
for both outdoor and indoor autonomous navigation scenarios. Contact our Sales team at
sales@clearpathrobotics.com for more information on these software packages.

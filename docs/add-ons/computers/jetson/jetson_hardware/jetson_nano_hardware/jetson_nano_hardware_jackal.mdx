### Step 2: Install the Nano

:::note

Custom mounting brackets are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/jetson_setup/raw/melodic/models/JetsonNanoXavierJackalMount.stl).

:::

1. Print off the mount from above using a 3D printer. A 0.2 mm layer thickness should be sufficient.

2. Add 4X M3 stand-offs to the board mount points. A 6 mm height is recommended.

5. Make a power cable that connects to the 12 V user
   power (Molex connector) to a barrel connector with center positive. Refer
   to the [Jackal User Manual](/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/jackal/user_manual_jackal) for the
   pinout of the user power.

   :::warning

   Do NOT plug this into the ITX power plug on the power distribution board.

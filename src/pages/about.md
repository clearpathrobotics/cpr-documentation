## About Clearpath Robotics

Clearpath was started in a basement by four friends who loved building robots in university.
After experiencing their own frustrations in the lab, they wanted to make robotics research easier.
Persisting, failing, iterating and finally succeeding on the build of their first unmanned vehicle, Clearpath Robotics was born.

Since then, the company has grown.
We have robots and customers all over the world.
Our offices are bigger and we have real desks, but we’ve held on to the spirit with which we began: be genuine, listen to customers, and keep it beautifully simple.
Our team is passionate about building robots for the greater good.
We love to problem solve, make innovative ideas a reality, and play the occasional game of frisbee over lunch.
We’re the leader in research robotics and blazing the trail for robots in industry.

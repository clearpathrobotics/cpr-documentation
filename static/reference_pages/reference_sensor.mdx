## Troubleshooting

**Sensor is not turning on**

1.  Turn the robot off
2.  Check that connectors are fully seated
3.  Turn on the robot and see if the sensor is turning on
4.  If it does not turn on, unplug the rectangular power connector
5.  With a multimeter, measure the voltage across positions 2 and 6 on the robot's connector
6.  If the measurement is 12 V, then there is likely an issue with the sensor, and you should contact Clearpath Robotics
7.  If the measurement is 0 V, then the 12 V fuse on your robot has likely failed. Shut off the robot, replace the fuse, and then replace the sensor's rectangular connector.

# Hidden Page Example

- This page should not appear in the sidebar since this file is located in the `/src/pages/` directory, rather than in `/docs`.
- Similarly, you cannot navigate to the file `_hiddenPageExampleContent` because it has an underscore at the begnning of the filename.
  Docusaurus does not build routing paths to filenames that start with an underscore.
- This 2 file system seems necessary to protect content from users without login credentials.
  The main file runs the React component BlockedPageRouting, to see what content should be rendered.
  This ensures that the unprivileged user cannot find the content by using through their web browser's developer tools to review the HTML.

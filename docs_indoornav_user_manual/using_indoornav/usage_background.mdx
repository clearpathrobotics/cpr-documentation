The robot's main PC is located inside the robot and runs the `roscore`
process. All sensors are connected to the robot's main PC over USB or
ethernet, as required by the specific sensor.

The IndoorNav backpack PC communicates over an ethernet connection with
the main PC. All of the localization and path-planning is done on the
backpack PC. The backpack PC does not have any direct connection to the
wireless network; all traffic to/from the user's web browser is routed
via the robot's main PC.

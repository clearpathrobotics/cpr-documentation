IndoorNav can be executed through the OutdoorNav software if both are available. 
To switch between the modes in OutdoorNav select the 'Navigation Mode' option found
in the hamburger menu. This will navigate to a page that shows the current mode and 
provides an option to switch modes. When in IndoorNav mode the user may navigate to 
the IndoorNav Web GUI directly or work within the OutdoorNav view as can be seen 
below.

:::note

When in IndoorNav mode the OutdoorNav Autonomy software is switched off. The UI will 
disable OutdoorNav UI features related to Autonomy but will still allow users the 
option to view camera streams.

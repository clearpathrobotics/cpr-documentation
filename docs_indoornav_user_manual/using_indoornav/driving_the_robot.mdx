IndoorNav offers several different methods to drive the robot, in
addition to using the included game controller, interactive markers in
Rviz, or publishing directly to `/cmd_vel`.

:::warning

CAUTION! Failure to follow these instructions may result in MINOR or
MODERATE INJURY or DAMAGE to the system or property.

:::

:::warning

IMPACT HAZARD! Always maintain a safe distance from a robot in
operation. A robot being operated in manual mode should only be operated
by personnel who have been trained and authorized according to the
standards of the facility in which the robot is in use. Be aware of the
Emergency Stop button locations.

## Driving the Robot in Manual Mode

:::note

See [detailed documentation on manual driving](https://docs.ottomotors.com/Archive/2-22/out/en/51722-51784-driving-a-robot-in-manual-mode.html)
for more information.

:::

The Web GUI allows teleoperation of the robot without using the included
game controller. To enable manual driving, select either the Drive or
Facility tab and use the on-screen controls in the lower-right corner,
as shown in the figure below. Moving the virtual joystick up/down will
drive the robot forward/backward, and moving it left/right will make the
robot turn.

The first time you access the Web GUI after powering-on the robot, the
robot may be in neutral. Click the <img src="/img/indoornav_images/IndoorNav/driveNeutralButton.png" width="16px" /> button to take the robot out of neutral.

Clicking the <img src="/img/indoornav_images/IndoorNav/driveSettingsButton.png" width="16px" /> will open the drive settings, allowing you to adjust the
robot's driving speed or disable manual driving, shown in the figure
below.

## Driving the Robot in Autonomous Mode

:::note

See [detailed documentation on autonomous driving](https://docs.ottomotors.com/Archive/2-22/out/en/51722-51785-driving-a-robot-in-autonomous-mode.html)
for more information.

:::

To drive the robot in autonomous mode the steps are:

1.  Create a map. See [Making a Map](/docs_indoornav_user_manual/maps#making-a-map) for
    details.

2.  Confirm that the **Manual** toggle is disabled and manual driving
    mode is OFF. When disabled, the **Drive Mode** toggle is gray and a
    **Move** button will be displayed.

3.  Select **Move**.

4.  Select the location on the map to which the robot should drive. The
    joystick button will turn green and the orientation circle will be
    displayed at the selected location on the map.

5.  Move the green line inside the orientation circle to define the
    direction in which the front of the robot should be directed when it
    stops at the selected location.

6.  Select **Go** to send the robot on its way. Select **Stop** to stop
    the robot at any time.

## Driving Using Endpoints

:::note

See [detailed documentation on driving using endpoints](https://docs.ottomotors.com/Archive/2-22/out/en/51722-51786-driving-a-robot-using-endpoints.html)
for more information.

:::

To drive the robot using endpoints the steps are:

1.  Create a map. See [Making a Map](/docs_indoornav_user_manual/maps#making-a-map) for
    details.
2.  Add Endpoints to the map. See [Adding Endpoints](/docs_indoornav_user_manual/maps#adding-endpoints) for details.
3.  Select an Endpoint.
4.  Select **Go** to send the robot on its way. Select **Stop** to stop
    the robot at any time.

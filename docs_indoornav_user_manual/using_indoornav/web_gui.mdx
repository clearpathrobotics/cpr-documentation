The easiest method of interacting with IndoorNav is via the web GUI. The
following conditions must be met in order for the web GUI to function
correctly:

1.  IndoorNav is running (see [Manually Starting IndoorNav](/docs_indoornav_user_manual/base_robot_config/config_starting_manually.mdx)
    or [Automatically Starting IndoorNav](/docs_indoornav_user_manual/base_robot_config/config_starting_automatically.mdx),
2.  the robot is connected to a wireless access point,
3.  your laptop or desktop is connected to the same network as the
    robot,
4.  you know the robot's IP address on the wireless network (or can
    resolve its hostname to the wireless IP address), and
5.  port-forwarding has been enabled on the robot.

The web interface operates over `http` on port `TCP/5000`.

To access the web interface, open your web browser and navigate to the
robot's IP address on port 5000, e.g.: ```http://192.168.0.197:5000```

:::note

Google Chrome 62.x or later is recommended. Other modern browsers, such
as Firefox 95.x or later and Chromium 95.x or later will likely also
work, but have not been tested as thoroughly as Google Chrome.

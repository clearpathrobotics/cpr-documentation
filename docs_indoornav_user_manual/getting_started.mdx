Clearpath Robotics' IndoorNav all-in-one package contains everything
you need to allow your robot to navigate autonomously in indoor
environments. IndoorNav is based on indoor autonomy software developed
by OTTO Motors and has been adapted to run on Clearpath Robotics'
robots.

This document will explain how to set up and use the IndoorNav software
on your supported Clearpath Robotics robot. Supported robots include:

-   [Dingo-D](https://clearpathrobotics.com/dingo-indoor-mobile-robot/)
    and [Dingo-O](https://clearpathrobotics.com/dingo-indoor-mobile-robot/)

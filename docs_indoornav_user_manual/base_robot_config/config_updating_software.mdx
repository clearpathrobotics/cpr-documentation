Updating IndoorNav is split into two separate operations: minor updates
and major updates.

Minor updates affect only the robot's main PC and can be done by
connecting the robot to the internet and running

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

If you have been instructed by Clearpath Robotics' support team that
you should update your IndoorNav backpack PC, you should follow the
instructions at [Installing Backpack Software](/docs_indoornav_user_manual/installing_backpack_software.mdx).

If you want IndoorNav to start automatically when the robot boots you
may create a systemd job to start it automatically:

```bash
rosrun cpr_indoornav_ROBOT install
```

where `ROBOT` is your supported Clearpath platform:

-   `dingo`
-   `husky`
-   `jackal`
-   `ridgeback`

This command will create a new systemd job called `cpr-indoornav` which
will start automatically when the robot boots. This systemd job depends
on the robot's core `ros` systemd job. If you need to restart IndoorNav
it is recommended that you restart both services:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cpr-indoornav
sudo systemctl restart ros
sudo systemctl start cpr-indoornav
```

Once you have configured apt and rosdep, you can install the IndoorNav
libraries and their dependencies on your robot by running:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-cpr-indoornav-ROBOT
```

where _ROBOT_ is replaced with the model of Clearpath robot
you are installing:
- `dingo` for Dingo-O or Dingo-D,
- `husky` for Husky A200,
- `jackal` for Jackal J100, or
- `ridgeback` for Ridgeback.

This will automatically install the required launch files and
dependencies.

Once the packages are installed, run the following to configure the
IndoorNav software:

```bash
rosrun cpr_indoornav setup
```

This script will install additional necessary packages, configure
`apache2` to act as a proxy server to the IndoorNav backpack, configure
SSH credentials to allow ROS to launch nodes on the backpack PC
automatically, and configure the networking between the main PC and
backpack to ensure the hostnames and IP addresses are configured
correctly. The `setup` script is interactive; you will be prompted to
enter your password more than once and select options from multiple
menus.

Once you have finished running the setup script, reboot the robot to
finish.

For more details on the networking configuration the
`cpr_indoornav setup` script performs, please see
[Configuring the Network Bridge](/docs_indoornav_user_manual/network_config.mdx#config-network-bridge).

:::note

Most users will not require this step as robots from Clearpath Robotics
will ship with the Robot OS installed and configured. Only users that
are upgrading an OS or restoring a robot to factory settings will need
to perform these steps so that their robot is compatible with IndoorNav.

:::

:::note

IndoorNav is only supported on robots running ROS Noetic on Ubuntu
20.04.

:::

Follow the instructions in your robot's user manual to reinstall the
default OS. The links below contain the instructions for reinstalling
Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic on all robots that support IndoorNav:

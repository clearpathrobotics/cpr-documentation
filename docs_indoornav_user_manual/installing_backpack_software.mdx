:::note

Before you can configure the IndoorNav backpack, you must contact
Clearpath Robotics' customer support and ask to be sent an archive
containing additional files needed. You will need to copy this archive
onto the backpack PC as noted below.

:::

Your IndoorNav backpack PC comes with the latest supported version of
IndoorNav pre-installed. If you need to update or reinstall the software
on the backpack PC, first update the OS using the procedure outlined
here: <https://docs.ottomotors.com/en/51722-52149-updating-individual-robots.html>.

Once the OS has been updated you will need to connect a monitor,
keyboard, and wired internet connection to backpack PC. Power-on the PC
and log in using the backpack's default username and password.

After logging in you may now copy the `.tar.gz` file supplied by
Clearpath Robotics onto the backpack. Make a note of the path to this
file, as you will need it in the following steps.

Run the following commands to establish a wired internet connection:

```bash
sudo ip link delete sbr0 type bridge
sudo dhclient eno1
```

You may need to replace `eno1` with a different interface ID, depending
on the physical ethernet port you have connected to your router. Other
common examples are `enp2s0`, `enp3s0`, and `eth0`. Running the `ip a`
command will show all available network interfaces.

Run the following commands to download the setup script to complete the
rest of the backpack software installation:

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr-indoornav-install.git
cd cpr-indoornav-install
bash install.sh
```

The `install.sh` script is interactive and will prompt you for the
following pieces of information (not necessarily in this order):

- a new hostname for the backpack PC
- the hostname of your robot's primary PC
- the path to the `.tar.gz` file you copied onto the backpack earlier

You must power-cycle the backpack PC after running
`install.sh` to finalize the configuration.

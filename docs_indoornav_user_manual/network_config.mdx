Normally the network bridge and port forwarding are configured
automatically when using the `cpr_indoornav setup` script (see
[Installing Required Software](/docs_indoornav_user_manual/base_robot_config/config_install_required_sw.mdx). This
appendix explains the network configuration of the robot's PC in more
detail.

## Configuring the Network Bridge {#config-network-bridge}

The first step to configure your robot for use with IndoorNav is to make
sure that the ethernet communication between the robot's PC and the
IndoorNav backpack works. All Clearpath robots are configured to bridge
their physical ethernet ports together. This allows all the ports on the
motherboard to operate on multiple subnets simultaneously. By default
Clearpath robots use the `192.168.131.0/24` subnet for their internal
network, with all IP-based sensors and peripherals operating on this
subnet.

IndoorNav requires modifying the default bridge to remove a single
ethernet port, `eno1` by default, from the bridge and assigning it to
the `10.252.252.0/24` subnet. This physical port will be dedicated to
communicating with the IndoorNav backpack PC.

To configure `eno1` to be used to communicate with the backpack PC,
modify `/etc/netplan/50-clearpath-bridge.yaml` as follows. The example
below bridges interfaces with the identifiers `eth*`, `enp*`, `enx*` and
`usb*` together on the `192.168.131.0/24` subnet.

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    # dedicated port for communicating with the IndoorNav backpack
    eno1:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      addresses:
        - 10.252.252.100/24

    # bridge all other ports together on the 192.168.131.0/24 subnet
    bridge_eth:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      match:
        name: eth*
    bridge_enp:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      match:
        name: enp*
    bridge_enx:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      match:
        name: enx*
    bridge_usb:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      match:
        name: usb*
  bridges:
    br0:
      dhcp4: yes
      dhcp6: no
      interfaces: [bridge_eth, bridge_enp, bridge_enx, bridge_usb]
      addresses:
        - 192.168.131.1/24
```

Instead of using `eno1` you can use a specific USB to ethernet dongle,
for example:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    # dedicated port for communicating with the IndoorNav backpack
    enx70886b8f17a5:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      addresses:
        - 10.252.252.100/24

    # bridge all other ports together on the 192.168.131.0/24 subnet
    bridge_eth:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      match:
        name: eth*
    bridge_eno:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      match:
        name: eno*
    bridge_enp:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      match:
        name: enp*
  bridges:
    br0:
      dhcp4: yes
      dhcp6: no
      interfaces: [bridge_eth, bridge_eno, bridge_enp]
      addresses:
        - 192.168.131.1/24
```

If you made any changes to the bridge configuration reboot the robot
now. Once the robot and backpack PC are both powered-on, connect them
with an ethernet cable connected to `eno1` on the backpack and the
IndoorNav port you configured above. Run the following command to check
that you can communicate with the backpack PC:

```bash
ping 10.252.252.1
```

Once you have configured the network interfaces and confirmed that the
communication works, ensure that the dedicated IndoorNav port is set in
the `cpr_indoornav` package's `config/cyclone_dds.xml` file:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<CycloneDDS xmlns="https://cdds.io/config" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://cdds.io/config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/master/etc/cyclonedds.xsd">
  <Domain id="any">
    <General>
      <!--
        This assumes that eno1 is configured to be a static port dedicated to communicating
        with the autonomy backpack. By default this should use the 10.252.252.0/24 subnet
        with the robot's PC at 10.252.252.100 and the autonomy PC at 10.252.252.1
      -->
      <NetworkInterfaceAddress>eno1</NetworkInterfaceAddress>
      <AllowMulticast>true</AllowMulticast>
    </General>
    <Internal>
      <LeaseDuration>5 min</LeaseDuration>
    </Internal>
  </Domain>
</CycloneDDS>
```

## Configuring Apache2 Proxy Server

IndoorNav operates a web-based mapping GUI that you can use to plan
routes, mark areas for specific tasks, view/edit the map, and the like.
To access this interface you should install the `apache2` package and
configure it to act as a proxy server for the IndoorNav backpack:

```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```

Create (or edit) `/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/clearpath.conf` to contain
the following:

``` 
Listen 2000
Listen 2001
Listen 5000
Listen 9091

<VirtualHost *:2000>
  ProxyRequests On
  ProxyVia On

  ProxyPass / http://10.252.252.1:2000/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://10.252.252.1:2000/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:2001>
  ServerName HOSTNAME       # replace HOSTNAME with your robot's hostname!!

  RewriteEngine On

  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]
  RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://10.252.252.1:2001/$1 [P,L]

  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} !=websocket [NC]
  RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://10.252.252.1:2001/$1 [P,L]

  ProxyPass / http://10.252.252.1:2001/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://10.252.252.1:2001/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:5000>
  ProxyRequests On
  ProxyVia On

  ProxyPass / http://10.252.252.1:5000/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://10.252.252.1:5000/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:9091>
  ServerName HOSTNAME       # replace HOSTNAME with your robot's hostname!!

  RewriteEngine On

  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]
  RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://10.252.252.1:9091/$1 [P,L]

  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} !=websocket [NC]
  RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://10.252.252.1:9091/$1 [P,L]

  ProxyPass / http://10.252.252.1:9091/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://10.252.252.1:9091/
</VirtualHost>
```

Make sure to replace the two instances of `HOSTNAME` in the file above
with your robot's hostname, e.g. `cpr-j100-1234`

Once `/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/clearpath.conf` has been modified,
restart the `apache2` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Configuring IP Tables

:::warning

It has been observed that using `iptables` to enable port-forwarding may
cause errors with the ROS 2 daemon. We recommend using the Apache Proxy
Server method described above.

:::

Instead of using Apache2 to act as a proxy server, you can instead use
the Linux Kernel's `iptables` to enable port-forwarding. If you enable
`iptables` you should also disable the `apache2` service to prevent the
proxy server from also listening on these ports:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl disable apache2
```

To configure `iptables` run the following commands:

```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo iptables --policy FORWARD ACCEPT
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 2000 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.252.252.1:2000
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 2001 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.252.252.1:2001
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 5000 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.252.252.1:5000
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 9091 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.252.252.1:9091
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
```

To make these changes permanent you should edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and
make sure that IPv4 forwarding is enabled:

```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

and install the `iptables-persistent` package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
```

If this package is already installed you can update the rules by running

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure iptables-persistent
```

Select **Yes** when asked if you want to save the IPv4 rules and **No**
if you want to save the IPv6 rules.

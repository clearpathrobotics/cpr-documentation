In addition to the Web GUI, IndoorNav provides a ROS 2 API for
programmatic interactions. Documentation for this API is included in the
`clearpath-api` package, installable with `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt install clearpath-api
```

Once the package is installed, the documentation can be found at
`/opt/clearpath/ros2-api-1.3.3/share/public`. Alternatively, the
documentation can be downloaded directly from
[docs.ottomotors.com](https://file-share.ottomotors.com/remote.php/webdav/OTTO%20Motors/Software%20Releases/v2.22/Clearpath_API_html_PDF_2.22.zip)
(requires an OTTO Motors account to log in).

## API Summary

The ROS 2 API is separated into 3 main categories, each operating on a
separate ROS 2 Domain, as outlined in the table below:

_ROS 2 API Domain IDs_

| Domain ID   | Description  |
|-------------|--------------|
| 100         | Fleet API    |
| 110         | Autonomy API |
| 95          | Platform API |

The Fleet API is intended to allow the robot to be controlled by an
external fleet manager.

The Autonomy API enables control of a single robot's autonomy and
navigation.

The Platform API is not available for use with IndoorNav. Instead of
using the Platform API, developers should use the base robot's ROS 1
nodes to interact with the robot hardware.

Additional details on the Fleet, Autonomy, and Platform APIs can be
found on
[docs.ottomotors.com](https://docs.ottomotors.com/Archive/2-22/out/en/51722-52217-robot-fleet-api.html).

## API Examples

OTTO Motors provides examples of working with their ROS 2 API. These
examples can be found in
`/opt/clearpath/ros2-api-1.3.3/share/clearpath_api/examples/`

To build the examples, create a Colcon workspace, copy (or symlink) the
examples folder into the `src` folder, and build using the
`colcon build` command:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/example_ws/src
cd $HOME/example_ws/src
ln -s /opt/clearpath/ros2-api-1.3.3/share/clearpath_api/examples/ $(pwd)/examples
cd ..
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source /opt/clearpath/ros2-api-1.3.3/local_setup.bash
colcon build
```

The `examples` folder contains 3 programs:

-   `send_move_goal`: command the robot to drive to an (X, Y, Yaw) position on the map
-   `monitor_odom_intent`: print the robot's odometry and planning data as it navigates
-   `get_map_info`: get information about the map saved on the robot

:::note

At the time of writing there is a known bug in the `get_map_info`
example; it always returns an empty array. This will be corrected ASAP.

:::

Refer to the source code for the examples for more information about
their use. All examples should be run using the Fleet API domain ID.

## Accessing Noetic Topics in ROS 2

The Clearpath Robotics base platform is configured to bridge sensor
data, velocity control, wireless connection status, power information,
and other basic topics into ROS 2 on domain ID 121. The bridged topics
are prefaced with the robot's hostname (with any hyphens replaced with
underscores). For example:

```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=121
ros2 topic list
/cpr_dora/battery_status
/cpr_dora/cmd_vel
/cpr_dora/front/scan
/cpr_dora/gx5/imu/data
/cpr_dora/imu/data
/cpr_dora/navsat/fix
/cpr_dora/rear/scan
/cpr_dora/wireless/connected
```

Publishing to the `{hostname}/cmd_vel` topic will drive the robot:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /cpr_dora/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.1}}' -r 10
```

All other topics are read-only and will publish sensor/power/wireless
information at the same rate as their ROS 1 topics.

## Using the ROS 2 API with ROS Noetic

:::note

At present the ROS 2 API is unstable when bridged into ROS 1 Noetic. You
are welcome to experiment with developing ROS 1 nodes that use the
bridged topics, but Clearpath Robotics can only offer minimal support.

:::

To enable bridging the ROS 2 Fleet and Platform APIs into the ROS 1 Noetic
master, set the `INDOORNAV_ENABLE_ROS2_TO_ROS1_BRIDGE` envar to `1` in
`/etc/ros/setup.bash`:

```bash
export INDOORNAV_ENABLE_ROS2_TO_ROS1_BRIDGE=1
```

This will start 2 `ros1_bridge` nodes (one for domain 110 and one for
domain 95). Bridged topics will be visible in the `fleet_api` and
`autonomy_api` namespaces when `rostopic list` is run.

You will need to build or install the `clearpath_api` messages and
service definitions for Noetic.

### Install Docker {#install-docker}

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/scripts/
./install_docker.sh
```

### Configure OutdoorNav Sensors {#configure-outdoornav-sensors}

Prior to configuring the sensors, ensure that you have measured the position (XYZ) and orientation (RPY) of each of your sensors w.r.t. the base_link. See your results from the [Integration Requirements](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/integration_requirements/hardware_integration_requirements).

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/scripts/
./configure_outdoornav.sh
```

### Finalize Setup {#final-setup}

The script in the sections below will reboot the computer it is installed run on.

##### Platform Computer

For installations of the OutdoorNav software on the platform computer (not a backpack computer), run the following:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/
pushd scripts
sudo ./setup_computers.sh
```
##### Secondary/Starter Kit Computer

Prior to running the script on the secondary/starter kit computer, ensure that you have the user and IP of the platform computer that the secondary/starter kit computer is connected to. Run the following:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/
pushd scripts
sudo ./setup_computers.sh -b
```

### Install OutdoorNav Software {#install-outdoornav}

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/scripts/
./install_outdoornav.sh
```
### Configure Platform Footprint {#configure-platform-footprint}

If the platform has sensors and/or parts that protrude outside of the platform body, then a few environment variables will need to be modified to adjust the footprint of the robot. Things that could be extending past the footprint culd include but not limited to:

-   GPS antennae,
-   Charging receivers,
-   Arms,
-   etc...

Change the environment variables fmor the Table below, in the following file:

```
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch
nano outdoornav_tuning.env
```

| Environment Variable        | Description                            | Default |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| **FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_POS_X**  | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the front of the robot | 0.5   |
| **FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_NEG_X**  | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the rear of the robot  | -0.5  |
| **FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_POS_Y**  | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the left of the robot  | 0.35  |
| **FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_NEG_Y**  | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the right of the robot | -0.35 |


### Starting OutdoorNav

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav up -d
```

### Testing OutdoorNav Installation

1. Ping all of the network sensors to ensure proper communication with the platform/secondary/backpack computer.

2. Check the following topics and make sure there is data being published to them:

``` bash
rostopic echo -n 1 /platform/odom
rostopic echo -n 1 /platform/cmd_vel
 
# IMU 1 (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/imu/0/data
 
rostopic echo -n 1 /localization/odom
 
# Velodyne 1 (if included)
rostopic echo /sensors/lidar/0/pointcloud
 
# Velodyne 2 (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/lidar/1/pointcloud
 
# Laser Scan Front (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/lidar/0/scan
 
# Laser Scan Rear (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/lidar/1/scan
 
# Realsense D435 Front (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/stereo/0/pointcloud
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/stereo/0/depth/image_rect_raw
 
# Realsense D435 Rear (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/stereo/1/pointcloud
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/stereo/1/depth/image_rect_raw
```

Once installation is complete, you can proceed to [Getting Started](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup) to start using the software.

Several hardware configurations are compatible with OutdoorNav Autonomy Software.
Select the checklist below that corresponds to your hardware kit.

- [OutdoorNav Starter Kit Hardware Checklist](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/integration_requirements/hardware_integration_requirements/starter_kit_hardware_checklist)
- [OutdoorNav Custom Kit Hardware Checklist](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/integration_requirements/hardware_integration_requirements/custom_kit_hardware_checklist)

In addition, ensure that the platform computer is configured correctly by reviewing the following checklist.

## Notes on Measuring Frame Relationships

### `base_link` Frame {#base-link-frame}

For mobile robots, `base_link` should be rigidly attached to the mobile platform.
It can be attached at any position of the platform to provide a point of reference.
We also expect the orientation of `base_link` to be in the NWU convention.
ROS standards for `base_link` can be found in [REP-103](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html#axis-orientation) and [REP-105](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html#base-link).

### Starter Kit Frame {#starter-kit-frame}

The starter kit frame (`starter_kit_link`) is located at the center of the bottom plate of the enclosure.
Its orientation is also in the NWU convention with the X-axis of the frame pointing out of the front RealSense camera and the Y-axis coming out of the side of the enclosure **without** the power and Ethernet breakouts.

### Sensor Frame

The sensors frame for each sensor will vary. Please consult the documentation for the specific sensor.

### Measuring Relative Pose

Consider frame A (eg. `starter_kit_link`) and frame B (eg. `base_link`), rigidly attached to the platform.
The relationship of A relative to B consists of two parts, the relative position and relative orientation.
The position of A relative to B can be obtained by measuring the distance (in X, Y, Z axes) from frame B to frame A, and providing that value in frame B's coordinate frame.
The orientation of A relative to B is obtained by rotating the axes of frame B until they line up with frame A, noting that results in each axis are the rotation angles of the orientation.
A trick for the orientation's sign is to remember that if you rotate the X-axis towards the Y-axis or Z-axis the rotation will be positive and that if you rotate away from the Y-axis or X-axis, it results in negative rotations.

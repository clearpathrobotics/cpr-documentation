**When tuning controllers, it is advised to always only modify one single parameter prior to each
test. This allows the user to analyze the effect of this single parameter on the controller performance.**

# Tuning Flowchart

When attempting to tune the navigation controller, it is recommended to follow the following
flowchart. Begin with setting up [Initial Parameters](#initialize_parameters) for your platform.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img

      width="1000"
    />
    <figcaption>Differential Drive Tuning Flowchart</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

**Condition Blocks**: The condition blocks can be seen in the flowchart as **RED** decision 
blocks and either contain tests needed to be run or features of the software that are 
enabled/disabled.

**Tuning Blocks**: The tuning blocks can be seen in the flowchart as **YELLOW** blocks where it
is expected that the user modifies a parameter prior to re-testing the controller.

## Conditions Blocks {#condition_blocks}

#### Velocity Deadband Tests {#velocity_deadband_tests}

The "**Velocity Deadband?**" condition block asks the user to verify if there is a velocity deadband that the platforms
motors must overcome in order to move the platform. (ie. what is the minimum velocity that the platform
is required to receive, in order for it to move).

To verify this, the user should set up two missions:

1. A single Waypoint that is 10-20 meters directly in front of the platform. This will verify 
the requried linear motion of the platform.
2. A single waypoint that is 10-20 meters directly behind the platform. The first part of the 
navigation to this point (ie. the rotation to face the Waypoint) will verify the required 
angular motion of the platform.

If the above tests demonstrate that the platform **is stuck** in a velocity deadband and is not moving,
then proceed to [Tune Deadband](#tune_deadband).

If the above tests demonstrate that the platform **is NOT stuck** in a velocity deadband (ie. it can
smoothly start navigating the mission), proceed to the following condition block: [Oscillation Tests](#oscillation_tests).

#### Oscillation Tests (Straights) {#oscillation_tests}

The "**Oscillations on Straights?**" conditions block asks if there are any oscillations present during
normal navigation along a straight path.

##### Tests

To verify the amount of oscilations around the reference path, the user should set up four 
missions, each of which should pass (or fall within the users requirements) prior to moving on from this section of the tuning. The start
and end points of each of the tests should be identical and the start position (XY) should
be noted/marked on the testing area.  Waypoint should be placed 20-30m away from the start 
position. The four platform orientations for each test are as follows:

1. Align the platform with a 0&deg offset from the Waypoint.
2. Align the platform with a 90&deg offset from the Waypoint.
3. Align the platform with a -90&deg offset from the Waypoint.
4. Align the platform with a 180&deg offset from the Waypoint.

See the image below to determine the placement of the platform. The red arrow indicates the
orientation of the platform with respect to the Waypoint.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/outdoornav_images/oscillation_tests_straight.png"
      width="1000"
    />
    <figcaption>Oscillation Test Start Orientations</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

It is not necessary to run all of the offset tests after every parameter change. It is enough 
to progress systematically through the tests as they succeed. That is, if 
there are no oscillations during a 0&deg offset test, proceed to run the 45&deg test and so on
and so forth. If the 0&deg offset test fails, then there is no need to run the other three tests before updating a parameter.
The condition has been satisfied when all of the test results in minimal to no
oscillations (or as is deemed acceptable).

##### Causes

Oscillations during navigation along straight paths can be caused by one or several of the following
reasons. They are listed here in order of likelihood of occurence:

| | Cause | Description |
|-|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Untuned MPC parameters | The default MPC controller parameters have been tuned for CPR platforms, and may not be the same for third-party OEM platforms. |
| **2** | Controller delay | There may be delay present in your platform between the time the navigation computes a command velocity and when the velocity is actually executed. This could appear as mechanical delay in your motors or even mechanical delay in the rotational components of platforms control mechanisms . It is rarely noticed when electrical motors are used. The effect of controller delay is most commonly noticed when when entering a straight from a curve or after a pure rotation.|
| **3** | Deformable Tires | If your tires are deformable, then after coming out of a pure rotation, while the platform may be facing the required direction of travel, a purely linear command velocity would cause the platform to veer off to the left/right. This in turn would cause the controller to correct itself, and place it into an oscillatory motion. |
| **4** | Uneven weight distribution | If your platform is carrying more weight on one side it may bias the platforms motion when being command straight and veer the platform off to one side. The controller would then consistently try to correct this bias by pulling it back towards the reference path, thus causing oscillations. |

To determine if causes 3 and 4 may apply to you, it is a good idea to run the following test:

1. send the following command to rotate your platform for one full rotation,
``` bash
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.3" -r 10
```
2. stop the rotation by stopping the command.
3. send the following command to move the platform purely forward,
``` bash
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
  x: 0.5
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0" -r 10
```
4. Analyse the motion and then stop the stop the linear motion. If the platform drifts left/right
during step 3, then your platform is likely to suffer from the effect of uneven weight 
distribution or deformable tires. (If not, there may be bigger issues). Further 
investigation/discussion with Clearpath would be required.

If the above tests demonstrate that the platform **is oscillating** around the reference path,
then proceed to [Reduce Oscillations](#reduce_oscillations_on_straights).

If the above tests demonstrate that the platform **is NOT oscillating** or **within an acceptable
range of oscillation**, proceed to onto the following condition block: [Velocity Increase](#linear_velocity_condition).


#### Linear Velocity Condition/Test {#linear_velocity_condition}

The "Increase Linear Velocity?" condition block asks if the user wants to increase the linear
velocity that the platform will travel along long straight paths. This does not mean that it will
always drive at this velocity, but it is the velocity that it will accelerate to on straights, 
when starting a mission and/or when coming out of a curve.

To test this we simply want to create a mission that sends the platform to a single Waypoint 
directly in front of the platform's current position. The Waypoint should be at least 20 meters
away from the current position and will depend on the linear velocity you wish to acheive.

If during the above test, the velocity **does not** reach the desired velocity, proceed to 
[Increase Linear Velocity](#increase_linear_velocity) and repeat the above test until the
desired has been achieved.

If the above test results in the platform's maximum velocity reaching the desired velocity,
then proceed to checking the two subconditions: [Goal Behavior](#goal_overshoot_tests) and 
[Cornering Behavior](#cornering_tests).

:::note

Only advance to the following condition block: [Collision Avoidance](#collision_avoidance_condition) 
if the platform's maximum velocity has reached the desired velocity and all subconditions are 
also satisfied. Ie. you have tuned the corner and goal behavior to within your allowable limits.

:::

#### Goal State Tests {#goal_overshoot_tests}

The "Goalpoint Overshoot?" condition block asks the user to check if, at the end of a mission,
the platform overshoots the goalpoint. This condition should always be checked every time the
velocity is increased. A similar test can be used as in the [Velocity Increase](#linear_velocity_condition) section.

If the test results in the platform **overshooting the goal point**, then proceed to 
[Tune Goal Behavior](#tune_goal_state).

If the test results in a **smooth deceleration to the goal point, with the platform completing its
mission within the requried tolerance, and NO overshoot**, then proceed to re-verifying that your 
changes have not caused any oscillations by returning to the [Oscillation Tests](#oscillation_tests).

:::note

Only advance to the following condition block: [Collision Avoidance](#collision_avoidance_condition) 
if the platform's maximum velocity has reached the desired velocity and all subconditions also
are also satisfied. Ie. you have tuned the corner and goal behavior to within your allowable limits.

:::

#### Corner State Tests {#cornering_tests}

The "Overshoot/Oscillations in Corners?" condition block asks the user to check if the platform
overshoots the entry to corners, and/or if the platform oscillates during the cornering. This 
condition should always be checked every time the velocity is increased.

A test should be designed so that the platform will navigate a curve/corner. This type of mission 
can be set up regardless of whether or not you have set a specified turn radius for the path planner.

The Waypoints for the test mission should be placed such that there is sufficient change in
orientation of the reference path that the controller will switch into its CORNER state. An example mission
is provided below which demonstrates said Waypoint placement (although an extreme case with lots of Waypoints
for vehicle with a large turn radius).

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/outdoornav_images/corner_mission_example.png"
      width="1000"
    />
    <figcaption>Example test mission (complex) for cornering tests</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

For the current case of differential drive platforms who are able to turn on the spot, simpler 
test missions can be used that change the heading of the platform more than 45&deg, at each 
Waypoint.

If the test results in the platform **overshooting the entrance to the corner/curve**, then proceed to
the first issue listed in [Tune Corner State](#tune_cornering_state).

If the test results in the platform **oscillating during the corner/curve**, then proceed to
the second issue listed in [Tune Corner State](#tune_cornering_state).

If the test results in the platform **navigating smoothly through all curves/corners, with no
minimal oscillations and no overshoot**, then proceed to re-verifying that your 
changes have not caused any oscillations during straights ([Oscillation Tests](#oscillation_tests)).

:::note

Only advance to the following condition block: [Collision Avoidance](#collision_avoidance_condition) 
if the platform's maximum velocity has reached the desired velocity and all subconditions also
are also satisfied. Ie. you have tuned the corner and goal behavior to within your allowable limits.

:::

#### Collision Avoidance Condition {#collision_avoidance_condition}

The final condition block asks the user if collision avoidance is enabled or disabled on the
platform. 

If collision avoidance is DISABLED, then you have completed tuning your platform.
**Congratulations!**

When collision avoidance is ENABLED, it is recommended to begin with a straight line test as in [Velocity Increase](#linear_velocity_condition)
but with an obstacle placed roughly in the center of the predicted path (ie. at the midpoint 
between the start and goal locations). This obstacle should be at least 30 cm tall
and at least 10 cm wide. The user should be ready to emergency stop the platform if they
notice it approaching the obstacle too fast or too closely.

If the test results in any unexpected bahvior, such as:

1) not stopping in front of the obstacle,

2) not navigating after stopping in front of the obstacle,

3) jittery motion navigating around the obstacle,

then proceed to the respective issue listed in
[Tune Collision Avoidance Behavior](#tune_collision_avoidance).


## Tuning Blocks {#tuning_blocks}

#### Initialize Parameters {#initialize_parameters}

1. Update the footprint offsets of the platform in the `${HOME}/cpr_outdoornav_launch/outdoornav_tuning.env` file.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/outdoornav_images/platform_footprint_offsets.png"
      width="450"
    />
    <figcaption>Differential Drive Tuning Flowchart</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

| Environment Variable | Description | Sign |
|----------------------|-------------|------|
| FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_POS_X | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the front of the platform. | **+** |
| FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_NEG_X | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the left of the platform. | **-** |
| FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_POS_Y | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the rear of the platform. | **+** |
| FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_NEG_Y | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the right of the platform. | **-** |

2. Update the [`vehicle_length`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) 
parameter to be the longitudinal length  (ie. along the x-axis) of your platform. This is not 
the sum of the above footprint x-axis magnitudes, but only the length of the platform body.

3. Update the following parameters with your platform specific maximums and minimums:

    * [`max_fwd_velocity`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)
    * [`min_fwd_velocity`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)
    * [`max_rev_velocity`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)
    * [`max_ang_velocity`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)
    * [`max_accel`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)
    * [`max_decel`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)
    * [`max_ang_accel`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)
    * [`max_lateral_accel`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)

4. Update the [`stiction_compensator_fwd`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) 
and [`stiction_compensator_yaw`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) to 
be equivalent to the minimum linear and angular velocities that the platform requires it to move 
(eg. `stiction_compensator_fwd` would be equal to `min_fwd_velocity`).


#### Tune Velocity Deadband {#tune_deadband}

To tune the velocity deadband, the user should at least start off by knowing the minimum 
linear and angular velocities that the platform motors can generate.

If not already set from the [Initial Parameters](#initialize_parameters) section, you should set 
the [`min_fwd_velocity`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) to the minimum
forward linear velocity that the platform can handle.

For each iteration of the linear deadband tuning, increment the following parameters by **0.05 m/s**
, until smooth linear motion is acheived from standstill:

- [`min_fwd_velocity`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)
- [`stiction_compensator_fwd`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)

For each iteration of the angular deadband tuning, increment the following parameters by **0.02 rad/s**
, until smooth angular motion is acheived from standstill:

- [`stiction_compensator_yaw`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)


#### Reducing Oscillation (Straights) {#reduce_oscillations_on_straights}

To tune the platform behavior on straights when dealing with the simple cause of untuned MPC 
controller parameters, we list the following parameters along with likely ranges and their initial
default values. The are listed in order of which parameter will have the most effect of improving
the performance of the current tuning block. 

| Parameter | Likely Range* | Default |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| [`yaw_weight`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)  | 90 - 120 | 18.0 |
| [`y_weight`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)  | 12 - 18 | 14.0 |
| [`endpoint_multiplier`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) | 10 - 20 | 10 |
| [`max_lookahead`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) |2.5 - 3.5  | 2.5 |
| [`x_weight`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) | 14 - 16  | 14.0
| [`lookahead_factor`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) |  1.4 - 1.6  | 1.45 |
| [`mpc_opt_maxiteration`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)* | 10 - 15 | 13 |
| [`discretization_steps`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)* | 6 - 10 | 8 |

:::note

\* These parameters should be changed with caution.

:::

When you are experiencing oscilations due to cause \#2 (controller delay) try the modifying the 
following parameters:

| Parameter | Likely Range* | Default |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| [`enable_delay_compensation`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#delay_compensation_params)  | true | false |
| [`controller_delay`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#delay_compensation_params)  | depends on your delay in your system. (usually between 300 - 1000 will provide changes to the performance) | NA |


No available solutions yet to resolve oscillations due to causes \#3 and \#4. Please contact 
Clearpath customer support at support@clearpathrobotics.com to discuss any related issue.

#### Increase Linear Velocity {#increase_linear_velocity}

** *The following instructions are only relevant if you are planning on
increasing the velocity of the platform above 2.0 m/s.* **

To increase the platform's maximum velocity, the following parameters should be modified.

First, the [`mpc_horizon`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) parameter
should be set to: 1.0

The following parameters should then be modified to the desired velocity ($v_{des}$). Ie. if $v_{des}=4.0$ m/s, then you should modify both parameters to be 4.0.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| [`max_fwd_velocity`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)  | $v_{des}$ |
| [`max_lookahead`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) | $v_{des}$ |

Finally, if you are increasing the velocity to a value greater than or equal to 4.0 m/s or if you
are seeing that the velocity is being limited even after changing the above parameters, 
it is possible to try and increase the size (width and height) of the local costmap in file:
`~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/onav_robots/params/platform/navigation/costmap_local.yaml`.
The limit in the velcoity is due to the fact that the lookahead distance at higher speeds ends 
up exceeding the size of the local costmap. By increasing it, we allow the controller to 
lookahead further and allow for that velocity increase.

#### Tune Goal State {#tune_goal_state}

A few different issues may have occured that led you to tuning the goal behavior. We list a 
few of them and the possible parameters that can be modified to improve the performance in and
around the goal point.

1) Overshooting the goal point can be caused by a few factors:

* Not decelerating fast enough or soon enough as the platform approaches the goal.

To tune for this issue, some parameters are listed in order in which they will have the most effect of
improving the performance of the current tuning block:

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| [`goal_horizon_threshold`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params)  | 2.0 |
| [`goal_slowdown_multiplier`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params) | 1.5 |
| [`goal_horizon_threshold`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params)  | 0.8 |
| [`endpoint_multiplier_goal`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params)  | 20 |
| [`x_weight_goal`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params) | 14.0 |
| [`fwd_v_weight_goal`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params) | 0.01 |
| [`fwd_a_weight_goal`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params) | 8.0 |


* The autonomy core not considering the goal complete because it has too high of a velocity as it
starts entering the goal tolerance.

To to tune for this issue, modify the following parameter:

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| [`max_speed_at_goal`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params)  | *depends on the deceleration of your platform* | 0.8 |

2) Oscillations (or jittery behavior) around the goal point are typically caused by the the
tolerance at the goal point being set too small. If they are too small and the platform is unable
to localize itself within the required position and yaw tolerances, then it will jitter and 
rotate to attempt to be a precise as you are expecting it to be. To resolve this, it is advised 
to slightly increase the goal tolerance parameters:

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| [`goal_tolerance_xy_rtk`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params) | 0.1 |
| [`goal_tolerance_yaw_rtk`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params) | 0.25 |
| [`goal_tolerance_xy_nortk`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params) | 0.3 |
| [`goal_tolerance_yaw_nortk`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params) | 0.5 |

:::note

If your platform has RTK corrections, then it is only required to modify [`goal_tolerance_xy_rtk`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params)
and [`goal_tolerance_yaw_rtk`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params). Otherwise,
only modify [`goal_tolerance_xy_nortk`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params)
and [`goal_tolerance_yaw_nortk`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params).

:::

A complete list of parameters that relate to the GOAL state can be found 
[here](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#goal_state_params), however, the above set of 
parameters is likely to satisfy the users requirements.

#### Tune Cornering State {#tune_cornering_state}

A few different issues may have occured that led you to tuning the cornering behavior. We list a 
few of them and the possible parameters that can be modified to improve the performance approaching
as well as in the corner.

1) Overshooting the corner only to enter the turn late

This issue occurs most often, when the controller is unable to slow the platform down early and/or
fast enough, prior to entering the corner. A reduction in velocity earlier in the approach to 
the corner will improve the cornering performance. Below some parameters are listed that will 
allow the user to improve the behavior entering corners:

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| [`corner_segment_slowdown`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#corner_state_params)  | false |
| [`corner_lookahead`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#corner_state_params) | 5.0 |
| [`corner_detection_threshold`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#corner_state_params)  | 0.15 |
| [`corner_slowdown_multiplier`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#corner_state_params)  | 1.5 |

2) Oscillations during the corner

To reduce the oscillations in the corners, some parameters are listed in order in which they will have the most effect of
improving the performance:

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| [`endpoint_multiplier_corner`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#corner_state_params) | 20.0 |
| [`curvature_slowdown`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) | 0.15 |
| [`controller_delay`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#delay_compensation_params) | 0 |
| [`y_weight`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) | 14.0 |
| [`x_weight`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params) | 14.0 |

The complete list of parameters that relate to the CORNER state can be found 
[here](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#corner_state_params), however, the above set of 
parameters is likely to satisfy the users requirements.


#### Tune Collision Avoidance {#tune_collision_avoidance}

A few different issues may have occured that led you to tuning the collision avoidance. We list a 
few of them and the possible parameters that can be modified to improve the performance approaching
as well as navigating around detected obstacles.

1) Platform not stopping in front of the obstacle

This issue would either occur if the collision avoidance has been disabled, or if the detection sensors
are not populating the costmap with the obstacle(s). To enable/disable collision avoidance:

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| [`ENABLE_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE`](../tuning_parameters/collision_avoidance_parameters#general_collision_avoidance_params)  | true |

For the case where the obstacle that you are using is not being detected by the detection sensors,
make sure that it is neither too short nor too thin. Use RViz to check that the local costmap is being populated with
the obstacle.

2) Platform not navigating after stopping in front of an obstacle

This issue is either due to the robot unable to replan around the obstacle, in which case the 
following parameters may help:

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| [`inflation radius`](../tuning_parameters/collision_avoidance_parameters#costmap_params)  | 1.0 |
| [`cost_scaling_factor`](../tuning_parameters/collision_avoidance_parameters#costmap_params)  | 0.5 |
| [`max_decel`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)  | 0.5 |
| [`max_accel`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#default_state_params)  | 0.5 |

or that the obstacle has gotten inside of the safety footprints causing the navigation to place the
platform in a collision state:

Consult the [Footprint Tuning](footprint_tuning) instructions to increase the safety footprint sets.
The user can also try increasing the stop distance from the platform to an obstacle as it decelerates 
to a stop.

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| [`enable_stop_distance radius`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#stop_distance_params)  | false |
| [`obstacle_stop_distance`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#stop_distance_params)  | 3.0 |

3) Platform has jittery motion navigating around the obstacle,

This issue is typically a problem when the safety footprints collide with the obstacle as it is 
trying to navigate the replanned path around the obstacle:

Consult the [Footprint Tuning](footprint_tuning) instructions to modify the safety footprint sets.

The user can also try increasing the stop distance of the platform to an obstacle.

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| [`enable_stop_distance radius`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#stop_distance_params)  | false |
| [`obstacle_stop_distance`](../tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters#stop_distance_params)  | 3.0 |


4) Platform suddenly reducing its velocity as it accelerates up to maximum

This issue is due to the safety footprints exceeding the length of the local costmap. Since the 
safety footprints increase in length as the velocity increases, the user must also increase the 
size of the local costmap. This allows the safety footprints to extend to their entire length 
without triggering a "false" obstacle detection due to the footprint exceeding the local 
costmap size. Increase the costmap using htese parameters:

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| [`local_costmap/width`](../tuning_parameters/collision_avoidance_parameters#costmap_params)  | $2 * l_{max\_footprint} + 0.5$ |
| [`local_costmap/height`](../tuning_parameters/collision_avoidance_parameters#costmap_params)  | $2 * l_{max\_footprint} + 0.5$ |

where l_{max\_footprint} is the length of the largest safety footprint.

The scope of Appendix C is to provide information on how to tune the various components of
OutdoorNav.

Instructions for tuning specific platform types can be found here:

- [Differential Drive (Skid-Steer) Dynamics](tuning_instructions/differential_drive_dynamics)
- [Ackermann Drive Dynamics](tuning_instructions/ackermann_drive_dynamics)


Lists of parameters related to each component of the autonomy can be found here:

- [Localization Parameters](tuning_parameters/localization_parameters)
- [Navigation Parameters](tuning_parameters/navigation_parameters)
- [Collision Avoidance Parameters](tuning_parameters/collision_avoidance_parameters)

In future releases, we will describe how the user can [Customize their UI](user_interface_customization)
as well as how to [Customize which Sensors](sensor_customization) are input into OutdoorNav.

The scope of work to transform a non-autonomous UGV into an autonomous
one will vary depending on the exact hardware capabilities and software
interfaces of the UGV. Development work will be required by Clearpath
Robotics, the end user, or a third party developer to bring the UGV into
compliance with the requirements listed in the table below. This may
involve implementing encoders and controllers to provide velocity
control of the platform and implementing a CAN bus to ROS interface with
kinematic control. The table below provides a general outline of the
requirements; the detailed requirements are covered in the following
sections.

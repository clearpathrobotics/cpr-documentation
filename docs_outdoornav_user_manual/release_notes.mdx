## 0.12.0

### New Features
-   Modified mission planning modes. Now includes:
    -   Map mode (which allows the user to create maps of an environment 
        and send mission using said map)
    -   Waypoint mode (which allows the user to create more direct mission 
        by placing waypoints directly on the Aerial overlay)
-   Added an Assisted teleoperation feature to prevent robot collisions with 
    obstacles when it is being teleoperated.
-   Added the upgrade command to the CLI tool. Customers can now upgrade their 
    software as long as they are eligible to be upgraded to the newest version.

## Autonomous Missions

1.  **How do I start, pause or stop a mission?**

    See [Mission Execution](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_autonomous_mode#mission-execution) for
    information on how to start, pause or stop a mission.

2.  **When I start a mission the UGV does not move. What could be the
    problem?**

    There could be one of several reasons for why this is happening:

    1.  Check that none of the onboard Motion-Stop actuators are
        activated.
    2.  Check that none of the wireless Motion-Stops are engaged. This
        can be checked via the UI (a red Status Indicator means
        Motion-Stop is engaged) or the onboard UGV lights (will flash
        when Motion-Stop is engaged).
    3.  If OutdoorNav is running on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV
        that is programmed with a Futaba controller, then ensure that
        the controller is turned off. If it is on then it will be
        sending "no motion" commands that will be overriding the
        autonomy commands.
    4.  Ensure that at least 1 Goal is enabled in the Goal Panel.
    5.  Check that the task settings have all been set for each Goal in
        the Mission. A missing task setting for a Move PTZ task will
        block the execution of the Goal it is in.

3.  **How do I delete a waypoint?**

    Make sure the **Edit Missions** toggle is enabled, then click the
    **Waypoint Mode** button. Now you can click the Waypoint you wish to
    delete. A drop down list will appear. Select **Delete**.

4.  **How do I add a Task to a Goal?**

    See [Add Task to Goal](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_autonomous_mode#add-task) for information on how
    to add a Task to a Goal.

5.  **How do I remove a waypoint from an existing Goal?**

    Open the Goal Panel. Select the Goal which you want to edit and
    expand the Waypoint list, if necessary. Make sure the **Edit
    Missions** toggle is enabled. On the map, select the Waypoint you
    would like to remove. It will be highlighted in the Goal Panel. You
    can then click the **x** beside that Waypoint in the Goal Panel to
    remove it from the Goal.

6.  **How do I add a waypoint to an existing Goal?**

    Open the Goal Panel. Make sure the **Edit Missions** toggle is
    enabled. Select the Goal which you want to add the Waypoint to.
    Select the Waypoint on the map. There will be a menu option to **Add
    Waypoint to Current Goal**. This will add the waypoint to the
    beginning of the goal. You can then drag and drop the Waypoint in
    the Goal Panel to place it in the order you need. This will only be
    possible using a mouse or touchpad as the touchscreen will not allow
    you to drag/drop the Waypoint.

7.  **Why is the "Save Image" Task failing?**

    Check the Goals that are enabled in your Goal Panel. If you see a
    red warning triangle beside the **Save Image** task it means that
    the settings for this task were not set. Set them and rerun the
    mission.

8.  **The navigation gets stuck on the ""Compute Path"" feedback.
    What should I do?**

    Power cycle the UGV by powering off the base platform. Wait 10
    seconds, then turn the base power back on. Allow 1-2 minutes for the
    software to start up and refresh the Web UI page.

9.  **The UGV position and/or heading are behaving erratically while the
    UGV is stationary. What should I do?**

    Power cycle the UGV by powering off the base platform. Wait 10
    seconds, then turn the base power back on, wait 10 seconds, then
    turn the computer power back on (labelled **PWR** on the port/right
    side of mast). Allow 1-2 minutes for the software to startup and
    refresh the Web UI page.

## Autonomous Docking

1.  **When trying to dock, my UGV drives towards the dock but stops 2
    meters away and remains there. "Docking Failed" is displayed in
    the UI feedback bar. How can I fix this?**

    It is likely that one of these 3 things occurred:

    1.  The Base Station was recently resurveyed, or
    2.  The datum was recently changed, or
    3.  The dock location was not set correctly.

    If any of these have occurred recently and you did not reset the
    dock location from the Web UI, you will need to do so by following
    the instructions in [Set Dock Location](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup#set-dock-location).

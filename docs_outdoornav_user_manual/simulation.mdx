Simulation with OutdoorNav Software can be useful in several ways.

- It provides an easy (and low cost!) way of evaluating the main
  features in OutdoorNav Software prior to purchasing.
- It allows missions to be planned, executed, and refined in a
  repeatable way prior to deployment on UGV hardware. This can be
  particularly helpful when integrating OutdoorNav into a larger
  software solution, such as a fleet manager.

At present, OutdoorNav Software simulation is restricted to internal
Clearpath Robotics development and select partners, but is planned for
full deployment. Check back soon for further details.

## Important Safety Information

The use of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) can result in unexpected and
dangerous behavior. Although Clearpath Robotics endeavors to create safe
and reliable software and systems, autonomous outdoor UGVs should not be
considered safe for unsupervised use around humans or other obstacles.
No level of safety and reliability of software and non-safety rated
hardware components is guaranteed.

Clearpath strongly recommends that users carry out a risk assessment
related to their application and deployment of autonomous UGVs. The
ISO-12100 standard [Risk assessment and risk reduction](https://www.iso.org/standard/51528.html) provides guidance on
performing risk assessments.

Functional safety in robotics is often achieved through the use of
safety related parts and control systems to minimize risks such as
safety LiDARs for obstacle detection. These hardware components must be
designed into the UGV hardware and can be tightly integrated with
navigation software. Clearpath Robotics recommends that this process be
undertaken after the product or process has been fully defined. It can
be a significant design effort.

## Safety Notice Levels

For Clearpath Robotics hardware and software, the risk level is captured
using the following types of labels.

## General Hazard Labels

Review the following to learn more about the labels that may be used on
Clearpath Robotics products. Hazards can also apply to attachments and
accessories used in conjunction with a Clearpath Robotics product. UGVs
from other providers may present additional hazards and risks.

## Safety Awareness

Personnel present during the operation of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle
(UGV) need to be made aware or be accompanied by personnel who are
familiar with the specific risks and hazards associated with autonomous
mobile robots (AMR). The following checklist identifies basic topics
that should be addressed by site-specific worker and visitor safety
orientation training.

<center>
  <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/caution_awareness.png" />
</center>

-   Proper PPE must be worn, including safety footwear (ie. steel toe).
-   Crossing into the path of a moving UGV should be avoided, as well as
    placing or throwing obstacles into the path of a moving UGV.

<center>
  <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/impact_awareness.png" />
</center>

-   Be aware that a UGV can be anywhere in the operating area of the
    facility at any time, and may pose a tripping hazard even when not
    in motion.
-   Personnel need to be aware of the UGV docking and charging areas,
    where detection fields are reduced.
-   Personnel should be aware that Clearpath Robotics UGVs LiDAR safety
    scanners use a class 1 laser and high intensity LED.
-   Personnel should keep all loose clothing and body parts away from
    UGVs, accessories, attachments, and payloads, while they are in
    autonomous operation. Using an Emergency Stop button is the only
    acceptable manner of interacting with a Clearpath Robotics UGV or
    attachment while it is being operated autonomously.

In addition to the preceding basic items for all workers and visitors,
the following should be considered for facility personnel, including
drivers of other UGVs:

-   When required to move a product manually, personnel must ensure it
    is in an Emergency Stop state or shut down completely and should not
    push manually for prolonged periods.
-   Alert personnel that while operating a Clearpath Robotics UGV
    outside of the Autonomy State, they are solely responsible for
    obstacle and collision avoidance.
-   Maintenance of a Clearpath UGV not outlined in either this document
    or the operations and maintenance manual can only be performed by a
    Clearpath Robotics Authorized Personnel.

To reduce the risk of harming people or damaging properties, a trained
operator must monitor the behavior of the UGV under autonomous
navigation mode at all times. The operator should use the wireless
emergency stop device to immediately avert any possible damaging or
dangerous behavior from the UGV. Failure in proper use of the software
might result in collision of the UGV into objects.

-   The minimum height for detecting obstacles under ideal operation
    conditions (flat ground, no snow/rain/fog, normal operation of the
    LiDAR, etc) when using the standard Clearpath Robotics OutdoorNav
    Hardware package on a Husky is typically 0.2 meters high at 2.3
    meters distance away from the UGV. Your UGV may differ. Ensure that
    low-height obstacles are removed from the potential path of the UGV
    prior to operation.
-   OutdoorNav Software does not have negative obstacle detection
    capability. This means that your UGV will not detect stairs, cliffs
    or edges and may drive off these obstacles causing harm to people or
    properties as well as potentially damage the UGV.
-   Adverse weather conditions may obscure obstacle detection and
    avoidance data from the VLP-16 LiDAR. Obstacle detection and
    avoidance may not function properly in snow, rain or fog.
-   The current configurations of the OutdoorNav Software will continue
    navigation if the WiFi disconnects or goes out of range. The Web UI
    will reconnect once the WiFi has reconnected but certain functions
    of the Web UI may be limited such as the ability to issue a stop
    command or send new missions to the UGV.
-   If connection of the UGV to the base station is lost (e.g., WiFi
    goes out of range, low battery level, etc), UGV will not receive RTK
    corrections from the base station. This can potentially decrease the
    accuracy of the GPS signal which can subsequently degrade path
    following performance of your system.
-   Obstacle detection and avoidance is disabled during the docking and
    undocking operations. Keep this area clear of people and objects.

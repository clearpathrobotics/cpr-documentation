We have enabled Foxglove visualization as part of OutdoornNav, for improved debugging and data visualization and analysis.
To access the Foxglove visualization interface for standard OutdoorNav configurations, navigate to the following 
[URL](http://192.168.132.1/_/foxglove) (`platform_pc_ip_address`/\_/foxglove), where the _<platform_pc_ip_address>_ is
the IP address of the computer the host (UGV) computer.

For Husky Observer platforms specifically, you should access the Foxglove visualization page at http://192.168.132.1/_/foxglove
when connected to the base station.

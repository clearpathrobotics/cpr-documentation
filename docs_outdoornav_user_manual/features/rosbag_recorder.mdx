If you need to perform a quick rosbag recording from the UI you can do
so by navigating to the Settings dropdown in the hamburger menu and
select **Start rosbag recording**. This will record a rosbag of the
following topics (or all the topics in the namespace if followed by a
`/*`):

-   rosout_agg/*
-   rosout
-   twist_marker_server/*
-   localization_helper/*
-   localization_core/*
-   navigation/*
-   piksi_position/*
-   piksi_heading/*

To stop the recording navigate to the Settings drop down and select
**Stop rosbag recording**. This will save the rosbag with the date and
time as its file name in the onav_log/rosbag_data folder.

:::danger SAFETY WARNING

Making changes to any of the following variables may decrease system safety. It is recommended that users
only modify these parameters in consultation with Clearpath Robotics Support.

:::

:::note

Changes to any of the following variables will only take effect after power cycling the UGV.

:::

The collision avoidance feature of OutdoorNav allows our platforms to detect,
replan and then navigate around any obstacles that may be present in the UGVs
path. The workflow of this feature can be seen in the figure below.

  </figure>
</center>

The detection sensors available on the UGV will have their data filtered, if necessary into data
that can be fed into the costmap(s). The costmap will then use this filtered data
to generate two costmaps (local and global).

- **global costmap**: A large costmap (whose size is gets set relative to the
Waypoints of the desired mission) the replanned paths around detected obstacles.
- **local costmap**: A smaller costmap that is used solely for detecting potential
collisions and triggering the path replanner.

Therefore, there are two components in which we can tune the behaviour of the collision
avoidnace feature: the sensor filters or the costmap generation. We will expand on these below.

## Sensor Tuning

The following table lists the sensors that are useable with the
OutdoorNav software. The sensor drivers can be turned on/off using
these environment variables, however, the sensor will always remain
powered on. The environment variables, should be added to the
`~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/env/sensors_customization.env` file.

### Sensor Filters

:::info

It is currently only possible to use one filter of the 3D LiDAR filters (voxel, cropbox, radius, or statistical outlier) at a 
time on any source of data. In future releases we plan on expanding this to work as a filter chain.

### Costmap Generation

The following list of environment variables can be used to modify some
of the navigation inputs of to the OutdoorNav autonomy. It is
recommended that you first consult the following link(s) before
attempting to modify these parameters.

-   [Costmap2D/ObstacleLayer](http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d/hydro/obstacles)

| Environment Variable | Description                              | Data Type |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **COSTMAP\_LIDAR\_<2D/3D\>_OBSTACLE_RANGE** | The maximum range in meters at which to insert obstacles into the costmap using sensor data. This can apply for either 2D or 3D variables, associated with 2D and 3D lidars, respectively (front unit if more than one). | double |

## Limitations

The collision avoidnace feature as it currently stands, does come with some limitations. These are listed listed below:

#### Detection range limits

The maximum collision avoidance range for the OutdoorNav Software is
UGV-dependent and is related to the maximum speed of the UGV. These
ranges for Clearpath Robotics UGVs are:

-   Jackal UGV: 4.5 meters
-   Husky UGV: 4.5 meters
-   Warthog UGV: 15.0 meters

While the sensors are able to detect objects at further distances, the
OutdoorNav Software only considers obstacles detected within these
distances for collision avoidance. That is, the UGV will only begin to
decelerate as it detects obstacles within this range.

The detection itself is also related to the horizontal size
(width/diameter) of the obstacle. The limitations in detecting objects
with small horizontal size are described in the table below.

_Maximum Reliable Obstacle Detection Distance from UGV, according to Obstacle Horizontal Size_

| Object Size (Horizontal) | Starter Sensor Kit                                             | Standard/(CUstom w/ VLP) Sensor Kit                                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Less than 0.6 cm         | No reliable detection                                          | No reliable detection                                          |
| 0.6 to 1.0 cm            | 0.8 m                                                          | No reliable detection                                          |
| 1.0 to 3.0 cm            | 2.0 m                                                          | 1.75 m                                                         |
| Greater than 3.0 cm      | Maximum collision avoidance distance (UGV-specific; see above) | Maximum collision avoidance distance (UGV-specific; see above) |

Finally, the OutdoorNav Software bounds the obstacle detection to
prevent ground hits and to remove detections above the UGV body. The
following bounds are relative to the ground, assuming a flat surface.
Obstacles that are entirely below the lower bound or entirely above the
upper bound are not considered obstacles and will not be avoided.

_Obstacle Detection Vertical Bounds_

| Vertical Bound        | Jackal UGV | Husky UGV | Warthog UGV |
|-----------------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Lower Detection Bound | 0.3 m      | 0.3 m     | 0.3 m       |
| Upper Detection Bound | 0.8 m      | 1.3 m     | 1.8 m       |

:::note

The vertical detection bounds above are for the Standard Sensor Kit or a
custom sensor configuration that includes a Velodyne. The vertical
detection bounds for the Starter Sensor Kit have yet to be determined.

:::

#### Tall grass

**Description**: Grass that is taller than 15cm may occasionally be deteted as the robot is driving.

**Workaround Available?**: Yes (Mitigation)

**Mitigating Solution**: There are a couple of ways to reduce the amount of detections of long blades of grass.

1) Apply either a radial filter or a statistical outlier filter on the pointcloud data to filter out the stray detections.

- File: `~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/env/sensors_customization.env`
- Environment variable(s): `<sensor_type>_ENABLE_FILTER_RADIUS_OUTLIER`, `<sensor_type>_ENABLE_FILTER_STATISTICAL_OUTLIER` 

2) Increase the pointcloud to laserscan conversion filter minimum height parameter. The environment variable 

- File: `~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/env/sensors_customization.env`
- Environment variable(s): `PCL_TO_SCAN_MIN_HEIGHT`

#### Pitch changes

**Description**: Pitch changes along the UGVs planned path may cause the ground to be detected and
unwanted replanning may occur. This occurs because since we do not track change in pitch of the robot,
and since we filter the sensor data such that essentially chop off the lower portion of the data.
With the change in pitch this lower plane will then cause ground detections.

**Workaround Available?**: Yes (Mitigation)

**Mitigating Solution**: Limit the range from the `base_link` that the costmap generates lethal
obstacles, for a specific sensor. Eg. If your UGV has both a 3D and a 2D LiDAR. We want to limit
the range at which the 2D LiDAR will generate obstacles since the 3D LiDAR will cover a majority
of the detections. You would be able to reduce the range that the 2D LiDAR generates obstacles,
so that it does not overlap with the detection field of the 3D LiDAR.

- File: `~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/env/autonomy_customization.env`
- Environment variable(s): `COSTMAP_LIDAR_2D_OBSTACLE_RANGE` and/or `COSTMAP_REAR_LIDAR_2D_OBSTACLE_RANGE`

#### Branches across narrow path

**Description**: If there are overhanging branches across a path (ie. not coming from the ground),
the navigation may not be able to maneuvre through them.

**Workaround Available?**:  Limited to None

**Mitigating Solution**: Reduction of the global costmap `inflation_radius` and/or `costmap_scaling_factor`
parameters may provide sufficient space for the navigation to replan though the branches.

- File: `~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/env/onav_robots/params/<platform>/navigation/costmap_global.yaml`
- Environment variable(s): `/navigation/global_costmap/inflation/inflation_radius` and/or `/navigation/global_costmap/inflation/cost_scaling_factor`

:::info

See the bottom of [this](http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d/hydro/inflation) page for information on how the
costmap inflation layer costs are computed based on the above two parameters.

:::

#### Reflective surfaces

**Description**: Reflective surfaces on or around the robot can cause false positive obstacle placement
at incorrect locations on the costmap.

**Workaround Available?**: No software workaround available.

**Mitigating Solution**: Remove/cover/re-position all reflective surfaces on the robot.

Ensure that the [Safety](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/safety) document has been
read and the user is aware of possible hazards when using this product as well as the safety
methods that can be used to stop the moving UGV.

The Autonomous Mode of OutdoorNav Software is a set of robotic
navigation modules that enables robotics developers to define and then
autonomously execute missions on UGVs, getting work done without
requiring direct operator action. This software is composed of four main
modules: localization, navigation, safety monitoring and user control
unit. This a combination of Clearpath's proprietary packages and custom
configured open-source packages from ROS community. Please see the
software architecture section for more information.

## Definitions {#definitions}

The list below defines what a "Mission" is as well as its components.
These components are referred to throughout this manual.

-   **Mission** A Mission is a set of one or more Waypoints.
-   **Path** The list of Waypoints that will determine the path 
    for the specific Mission.
-   **Waypoint** A Waypoint is any geographical point referenced by its
    position relative to the datum in meters. 
-   **Task** A Task is an automated activity or wait time implemented as
    a ROS action at a specific Waypoint. Tasks are called in the order they are 
    added to a Waypoint.
-   **Ghost Waypoint** A transparent waypoint that is not part of the mission. This
    Waypoint appears between two other waypoints when in edit mode. The user can 
    drag and drop this ghost waypoint to add a new waypoint to the mission between
    the other two waypoints.

## Map Settings

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_map_settings.png" />
    <figcaption>Map settings</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To access the Map Settings: Menu → Settings → Map:

1.  **Map Offset:** The map tiles used in this software are not
    perfectly aligned with the real world. Therefore, the user may need
    to apply an offset to the map so that the UGV's position in the
    real world matches its position on the map.
2.  **Change Datum:** The datum is represented by a blue marker on the
    map and should be set to a location within 10km of the test site.
    The user can change this value in the Map Settings page. Enter the
    new values and click the "Set Datum" button.

## Mission Creation

To create a new Mission first ensure that the UI is in "Edit Mode" (
select the pencil icon in the bottom bar). Then open the drop down menu in the bottom
bar and select the "Add Mission" option. This will allow the user to create a new mission 
which can then be defined with Waypoints. 

### Waypoint Mode

To add new Waypoints to a mission while edit mode is enabled select the 
"Waypoint Mode" button. This will allow the user to place Waypoints at 
locations where the user clicks on the map. These will appear as red 
Waypoints with the exception of the first waypoint (green) and the last waypoint (yellow).

:::note

**The first Waypoint in the mission must be within 1.5 meters of the UGV's current position.**

:::

As Waypoints are placed, a "ghost waypoint" will appear between each pair of real
Waypoints and can be dragged to a new spot to insert a real Waypoint 
between them.  Waypoints can also be dragged and dropped on the map to 
modify their positions.

## Constrained Replanning {#constrained_path}

If constrained replanning is enabled the user can show on the path
deviation distance by navigating to the General settings in the
hamburger menu. Once enabled the area of possible deviation will show
over the planned route as can be seen in the following figure.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_route_deviation.png" />
    <figcaption>Route with deviation</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

:::note

If the UGV is manually driven outside of the constrained replanning area 
while a Mission is running, the Mission will need to be restarted as the UGV 
will no longer be able to find it's way back onto the path.

:::

### Waypoint Panel

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_waypoint_panel.png" />
    <figcaption>Waypoint Panel</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Enable the "Waypoint Panel" toggle to open the list of available Waypoints
within the selected Mission as shown in the figure above. The user can
now rearrange the list, rename Waypoints, add Tasks to the Waypoints, 
and modify the final heading and/or tolerance of each Waypoint.

### Rearrange List of Waypoints

Waypoints can be rearranged in order of operation in the list. To do this,
enable the "Waypoints Panel" toggle to access the list of Waypoints. Here, the
user will be able to drag and drop the Waypoints to reorder them.

### Rename Waypoint

By default, once Waypoints are created they are assigned a default name
which is the word "Waypoint" followed by a numeric value representing the
the number of Waypoints that have been created plus one. The user has the
option to rename these Waypoints in order for them to have more descriptive
meaning. 

To rename a Waypoint follow these steps:

1.  Enable the "Waypoint Panel" toggle. See [Waypoint Panel](#waypoint-panel) 
    for further details.
2.  Click the name of the Waypoint which the user wants to rename.
3.  Erase the current name and type the new name.

### Add Task to Waypoint {#add-task}

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_waypoint_tasks.png" />
    <figcaption>Add Task to Waypoint</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To add a Task to the end of a Mission:

1.  Click the "+" icon (beside the Gear icon) in the Waypoint Row the Task is
    to be added to.

2.  Click the "Add Task" Button that has appeared.

3.  Select the Task from the dropdown list. Standard waypoint icons will be
    replaced accordingly depending on the task selected (waypoint icons will keep the colours
    assigned to them based on placement).

### Custom Tasks  {#custom-task}

Users can create their own tasks following a specific template and place them within the **~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/custom_tasks** directory.
Restarting the UGV will trigger the system to load the custom task that was created, making it available for mission use.
Below is a sample template file named "input_looper.py" which iterates throught the two data variables and publishes them to the feedback 
topics. The purpose of this task is to simply outline what is available to the user when they decide to create their own tasks.

#### Sample Custom Task

This sample custom task iterates through the two available data variables and outputs them to the feedback topic. If neither of the 
variables have any data in them the task is aborted.  Each section will be elaborated further in the document.

```py
#!/usr/bin/python3

from onav_tasks.custom_task_base import *

class InputLooperTask(CustomTaskBase):
  def __init__(self):
    # The derived class must always call the super() and proved the action server name.
    # This name will need to be unique among custom tasks and must match what is in the 
    # UI. 
    super().__init__("input_looper")

  def run_task(self, goal):
    if len(goal.strings) == 0 and len(goal.floats) == 0:
      # Task and running mission will be aborted in this case
      self._as.set_aborted()
      return False

    # Loop through the strings and float values and publish them each to the /input_looper/feedback topic
    for string in goal.strings:
      self._feedback.state = string      
      self._as.publish_feedback(self._feedback)
      
    for num in goal.floats:
      self._feedback.state = str(num)
      self._as.publish_feedback(self._feedback)

    return True

def __create_task__():
	return InputLooperTask()
```

##### Custom Task Class

To leverage custom tasks users will need to create a new file that defines a new class which inherits from `CustomTaskBase`. The `CustomTaskBase` class is 
found in the `onav_Itasks.custom_task_base` package. It exposes a `SimpleActionServer` (see <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Simple%20Action%20Server%20using%20the%20Execute%20Callback%20%28Python%29">here</a> 
for further details) object as `_as`, a `UITaskFeedback` object as `_feedback` and a `UITaskResults` object as `_result` to be used as part of 
the tasks functionality. The custom task manager requires the user to also define a `run_task` method that takes a `UITaskGoal` object as a parameter.

```py 
from onav_tasks.custom_task_base import *

class CustomTask(CustomTaskBase):
  def __init__(self):
      super().__init__("input_looper")

  def run_task(self, goal):
```

##### Aborting Tasks 

When running the task users may handle errors through the action servers `set_aborted()` function.  When this function is called the entire mission 
will be aborted. In this sample the task is aborted if neither of the lists have any values.

```py 
if len(goal.strings) == 0 and len(goal.floats) == 0:
  # Task and running mission will be aborted in this case
  self._as.set_aborted()
  return False
```

##### Setting feedback

Users can set the feedback state using the `SimpleActionServer` class's standard methods. In this case the task iterates through the comma deliminated
strings and floats and writes them to the feedback state before publishing them.  Upon success the `run_task` method returns True.

```py 
for string in goal.strings:
  self._feedback.state = string      
  self._as.publish_feedback(self._feedback)
  
for num in goal.floats:
  self._feedback.state = str(num)
  self._as.publish_feedback(self._feedback)

  return True
```

##### Creating the Task 

All custom tasks will need to expose a `__create_task__()` method that returns a new instance of their class. If this isn't provided the custom task manager 
will not load in the module.

```py
def __create_task__():
  return InputLooperTask()
```

If a custom task is not configured properly the custom task manager will ignore the task and proceed loading in the next task while logging an error with ROS. 

### Advanced Settings

<iframe width="696" height="358" src="https://youtube.com/embed/V6K2VXM5EaU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Waypoint Heading

When creating a Waypoint, the user has the option of setting a final heading
for the Waypoint. For example, when creating a Waypoint at an inspection point,
the user may want the UGV to navigate and stop facing a certain
direction. In [Waypoint Panel](#waypoint-panel), the list of
Waypoints can be seen and the advanced settings of each Waypoint can be accessed
by clicking the "Gear" icon.

To set the Waypoint's final heading, the user will need to check the
"Final Heading Enabled" checkbox and enter the heading value in
degrees. The heading indicator on the top bar can be used to help set
this value. See the figure below showing the advanced settings.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_adv_waypoint_settings.png" />
    <figcaption>Waypoint Advanced Settings</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The heading that has been entered will only be applied to the Waypoint
(ie. the robot will only align itself with the correct heading at the
Waypoint). If the robot is required to be at specific headings at
other Waypoints the user will need to enter these in for each specific Waypoint.

#### Waypoint Tolerance

When creating a Mission, the user has the option of setting a specific
tolerance for each Waypoint. By default, the Waypoint position and orientation
tolerances are 0.3 meters and 180°, respectively. If a specific Waypoint
requires that the tolerances be either increased or decreased, these
values can be modified in the advanced settings. For example, if it's
required that the position and/or orientation at a Waypoint be very accurate,
such as 0.1 meters position and 5° orientation, or looser at 1.0 meter
position, this can be done within these settings.

In [Waypoint Panel](#waypoint-panel), the list of waypoints can be
seen and the advanced settings of each Waypoint can be accessed by clicking
the "Gear" icon. To set the Waypoint's tolerance, the user will need to
check the "Waypoint Tolerance Enabled" checkbox and enter the position and
orientation values, in meters and degrees, respectively.

## Mission Execution

### Start Mission

At the bottom of the UI, the user has the ability to start the currently
selected Mission by clicking the "Play" button <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_start_button.png" width="16px"/>. When the
Mission has been started this button will turn green. 

### Pause Mission

At the bottom of the UI, the user has the ability to pause the currently
running mission by clicking the "Pause" button <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_pause_button.png" width="16px"/>. When the
mission has been paused this button will turn yellow. Pausing a mission
allows the user to take time to look around with the camera or to
teleoperate the UGV to a nearby location to perform an inspection. For
ease of operation, the user must PAUSE the active mission if the user
wants to teleoperate the UGV.

### Cancel Mission/Task

At the bottom of the UI, the user has the ability to stop the currently
running mission or task by clicking the "Stop" button <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_stop_button.png" width="16px"/>. When the
mission/task has been cancelled this button will turn red. The name of
the mission/task will be shown to be cancelled in the feedback bar.

## Autonomous Docking

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_map_with_dock.png" />
    <figcaption>Dock Icon</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

### Docking The UGV

To dock the UGV autonomously, the user should follow these steps:

-   Enable the "Edit Mission" toggle.
-   Create a Mission whose Waypoints approach the dock from the front and
    whose final Waypoint is within the maximum predock distance which is shown as a circle around the dock.
-   Enable the Waypoints Panel toggle to view the list of Waypoints, rename the last
    Waypoint to "Dock Waypoint" or something descriptive and add the "Dock
    UGV" Task to this Waypoint.  If there is more than one dock in the system the user will
    have to open the task options and select the dock name from the list.
-   Run the Mission.

### Undocking The UGV

To undock the UGV autonomously, the user should follow these steps:

-   Enable the "Edit Mission" toggle. Select the "Waypoint Mode"
    button.
-   Select the Waypoint icon on the bottom bar to create a Waypoint at the 
    current location of the UGV. This step should either be it's own mission 
    or it should be the starting point of a mission.
-   Enable the Waypoints Panel toggle to view the list of Waypoints, rename this
    Waypoint to "Undock Waypoint" or something descriptive and add the
    "Undock UGV" task to the Waypoint that was just created.
-   Run the Mission.

### Compatibility with a Doghouse

In order for the autonomous docking feature to be compatible with a doghouse, the
doghouse must conform to a few specifications:

-   Must be installed on a flat surface, and have no elevation change between the
    charge-deck and the outdoor surface (ie. no ramp into the doghouse).
-   Must be greater than 1.2 m wide.
-   Must be between 1.5 and 2.5 m long.
-   Dock target should be installed centered along the back of the doghouse.

### Recover from Failed Docking or Undocking

If for any reason, the docking or undocking tasks fail, the user can:

-   Manually drive the UGV towards the dock target, aligning the
    charging unit with the receiver on the UGV.
-   Manually drive the UGV in reverse away from the dock target. It is
    suggested that the user reverse roughly 2-3 meters away from the target,
    then wait 1-2 minutes before starting any autonomous navigation
    missions.

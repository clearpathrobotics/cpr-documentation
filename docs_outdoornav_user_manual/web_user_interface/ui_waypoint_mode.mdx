Ensure that the [Safety](../safety.mdx) document has been
read and the user is aware of possible hazards when using this product as well as the safety
methods that can be used to stop the moving UGV.

The Autonomous Mode of OutdoorNav Software is a set of robotic
navigation modules that enables robotics developers to define and then
autonomously execute missions on UGVs, getting work done without
requiring direct operator action. This software is composed of four main
modules: localization, navigation, safety monitoring and user control
unit. This a combination of Clearpath's proprietary packages and custom
configured open-source packages from ROS community. Please see the
software architecture section for more information.

## Definitions {#definitions}

The list below defines what a "Mission" is as well as its components.
These components are referred to throughout this manual.

-   **Mission** A Mission is a set of one or more Waypoints.
-   **Path** The list of Waypoints that will determine the path 
    for the specific Mission.
-   **Waypoint** A Waypoint is any geographical point referenced by its
    position relative to the datum in meters. 
-   **Task** A Task is an automated activity or wait time implemented as
    a ROS action at a specific Waypoint. Tasks are called in the order they are 
    added to a Waypoint.
-   **Ghost Waypoint** A transparent waypoint that is not part of the mission. This
    Waypoint appears between two other waypoints when in edit mode. The user can 
    drag and drop this ghost waypoint to add a new waypoint to the mission between
    the other two waypoints.

## Mission Creation

To create a new Mission first ensure that the UI is in "Edit Mode" (
select the pencil icon in the bottom bar). Then open the drop down menu in the bottom
bar and select the "Add Mission" option. This will allow the user to create a new Mission 
which can then be defined with Waypoints. 

### Waypoint Mode

To add new Waypoints to a Mission while edit mode is enabled select the 
"Waypoint Mode" button. This will allow the user to place Waypoints at 
locations where the user clicks on the map. These will appear as red 
Waypoints with the exception of the first waypoint (green) and the last waypoint (yellow).

:::note

**The first Waypoint in the Mission must be within 3.0 meters of the UGV's current position.**

:::

As Waypoints are placed, a "ghost waypoint" will appear between each pair of real
Waypoints and can be dragged to a new spot to insert a real Waypoint 
between them.  Waypoints can also be dragged and dropped on the map to 
modify their positions.

### Waypoint Panel

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_waypoint_panel.png" />
    <figcaption>Waypoint Panel</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Enable the "Waypoint Panel" toggle to open the list of available Waypoints
within the selected Mission as shown in the figure above. The user can
now rearrange the list, rename Waypoints, add Tasks to the Waypoints, 
and modify the final heading and/or tolerance of each Waypoint. The user can 
also rename the mission and apply Tasks to when the Mission starts and stops.

### Rename Mission

To rename the Mission click the Mission name as it appears in the upper left
hand corner.  This should change the text into an input box that can then be 
modified. Press enter/click aside to save the change.

### Mission Tasks

A Mission can have Tasks assigned to when it starts and when it stops. These 
Tasks will run in the order they are listed in and will always run whenever the Mission
starts or stops.  

### Rearrange List of Waypoints

Waypoints can be rearranged in order of operation in the list. To do this,
enable the "Waypoints Panel" toggle to access the list of Waypoints. Here, the
user will be able to drag and drop the Waypoints to reorder them.

### Rename Waypoint

By default, once Waypoints are created they are assigned a default name
which is the word "Waypoint" followed by a numeric value representing the
the number of Waypoints that have been created plus one. The user has the
option to rename these Waypoints in order for them to have more descriptive
meaning. 

To rename a Waypoint follow these steps:

1.  Enable the "Waypoint Panel" toggle. See [Waypoint Panel](#waypoint-panel) 
    for further details.
2.  Click the name of the Waypoint which the user wants to rename.
3.  Erase the current name and type the new name.

### Add Task to Waypoint {#add-task}

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_waypoint_tasks.png" />
    <figcaption>Add Task to Waypoint</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

To add a Task to the end of a Mission:

1.  Click the "+" icon (beside the Gear icon) in the Waypoint Row the Task is
    to be added to.

2.  Click the "Add Task" Button that has appeared.

3.  Select the Task from the dropdown list. Standard waypoint icons will be
    replaced accordingly depending on the task selected (waypoint icons will keep the colours
    assigned to them based on placement). Waypoints in the table will also have a small icon to indicate
    if tasks are assigned to the Waypoint accordingly.

4.  The check box next to the Task name controls mission behaviour in the event that the Task fails.  If the checkbox is 
    checked the Mission will proceed to the next step in it's process, such as the next task or navigating to the next Waypoint. 
    If its not checked, the Mission will become cancelled upon the Task's failure.
5.  Click the Gear icon next to the selected Task to add the required
    Settings.

    :::note

    If a waypoint has more than one task assigned to it, the icon will
    be replaced with <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/multiTask_40px.png" width="30px"/>

#### Waypoint Heading

When creating a Waypoint, the user has the option of setting a final heading
for the Waypoint. For example, when creating a Waypoint at an inspection point,
the user may want the UGV to navigate and stop facing a certain
direction. In [Waypoint Panel](#waypoint-panel), the list of
Waypoints can be seen and the advanced settings of each Waypoint can be accessed
by clicking the "Gear" icon.

To set the Waypoint's final heading, the user will need to check the
"Final Heading Enabled" checkbox and enter the heading value in
degrees. The heading indicator on the top bar can be used to help set
this value. See the figure below showing the advanced settings. 

:::note

Waypoints that have a heading or tolerance assigned to them will show a different colour 
on their settings icon.

:::

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_adv_waypoint_settings.png" />
    <figcaption>Waypoint Advanced Settings</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The heading that has been entered will only be applied to the Waypoint
(ie. the robot will only align itself with the correct heading at the
Waypoint). If the robot is required to be at specific headings at
other Waypoints the user will need to enter these in for each specific Waypoint.

#### Waypoint Tolerance

When creating a Mission, the user has the option of setting a specific
tolerance for each Waypoint. By default, the Waypoint position and orientation
tolerances are 0.3 meters and 180°, respectively. If a specific Waypoint
requires that the tolerances be either increased or decreased, these
values can be modified in the advanced settings. For example, if it's
required that the position and/or orientation at a Waypoint be very accurate,
such as 0.1 meters position and 5° orientation, or looser at 1.0 meter
position, this can be done within these settings.

In [Waypoint Panel](#waypoint-panel), the list of waypoints can be
seen and the advanced settings of each Waypoint can be accessed by clicking
the "Gear" icon. To set the Waypoint's tolerance, the user will need to
check the "Waypoint Tolerance Enabled" checkbox and enter the position and
orientation values, in meters and degrees, respectively.

### Constrained Replanning {#constrained_path}

To enable the visualization of the contrained area of traversal (defined by 
the path contraint around the reference path), navigate to the General settings
in the hamburger menu. Enable/disable the visualization of the path ui_route_deviation
distance using the switch button (see image below).

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_general_settings.png" />
    <figcaption>General settings</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Once enabled the area of possible deviation will show
over the planned route as can be seen in the following figure.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_route_deviation.png" />
    <figcaption>Route with maximum path deviation</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

:::note

If the UGV is manually driven outside of the constrained replanning area 
while a Mission is running, the Mission will not be able to be resumed until the 
UGV is returned within the navigable area defined by the path contraint.

## Mission Execution

### Start Mission

There are multiple ways to start a Mission. At the bottom of the UI, the user has the ability to start the currently
selected Mission by clicking the "Play" button <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_start_button_simple.png" width="16px"/>. 
Starting the Mission this will start the Mission from the first Waypoint. The user may also select the drop down next to the button 
to start the Mission from the current UGV position. This is a useful way to start a Mission in the event that the UGV was blocked by 
obstacles that were later moved. Another way that a user can start a Mission is by selecting a waypoint in edit mode and then clicking on 
"Start Mission from Here" option. If the UGV is within 3 metres of that Waypoint the Mission will start from there.

  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_start_from_waypoint.png" />
    <figcaption>Starting from a specific Waypoint</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

When the Mission has been started the Play button will turn green, regardless of how it has been started. 

### Pause Mission

At the bottom of the UI, the user has the ability to pause the currently
running mission by clicking the "Pause" button <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_pause_button.png" width="16px"/>. When the
mission has been paused this button will turn yellow. Pausing a mission
allows the user to take time to look around with the camera or to
teleoperate the UGV to a nearby location to perform an inspection. For
ease of operation, the user must PAUSE the active mission if the user
wants to teleoperate the UGV.

### Cancel Mission/Task

At the bottom of the UI, the user has the ability to stop the currently
running mission or task by clicking the "Stop" button <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/ui_stop_button.png" width="16px"/>. When the
mission/task has been cancelled this button will turn red. The name of
the mission/task will be shown to be cancelled in the feedback bar.

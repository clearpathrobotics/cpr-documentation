The Manual Mode in the Web UI allows the user to operate the UGV
remotely (teleoperate) by using sensors on the UGV to visualize the
environment and by using a joystick to control the motion of the UGV.

Ensure that you have read [Safety](../safety.mdx) and are
aware of possible hazards when using this product as well as the safety
methods that can be used to stop the moving UGV.

1.  **Error/Warning Bar:** A bar along the top of the page reporting
    the error or warning status of the Assisted Teleoperation feature.
2.  **User Connections:** Shows the number of users connected to Outdoor Nav.
3.  **Joystick:** The joystick will allow the user to move the UGV
    manually from the UI. Motion can be sent to the UGV in 360Â°
    directions and the speed can be controlled by the distance of the
    joystick from its neutral position. Four fixed direction buttons are
    now present to move the UGV in purely forward/reverse directions or
    clockwise/counter-clockwise. Finally, we overlay an obstacle map
    on top of the joystick, representing obstacle distances from the
    UGV.
4.  **Speedometer:** An indicator of the UGV's current linear speed.
5.  **Sensitivity Scale:** A UGV-specific scale that controls the
    maximum allowable UGV velocities at each level. The default maximum
    linear velocity is 1.0 meters per second and the maximum angular
    velocity is 0.5 radians per second. These can be changed in the
    [General Settings](./ui_overview.mdx#config-general-settings) page.
    The scale levels are 100%, 80%, 50% and 20%, with the default set
    to 80%.
6.  **Teleop Assist Toggle:** The "Teleop Assist" toggle can be used to
    enable/disable the Assisted Teleoperation feature.
7.  **UI Lockout:** The lockout toggle that will prevent the Joystick from 
    sending commands to the UGV. The purpose of this is to help prevent 
    interference with the UGV by accidental input from the user.  This feature
    does not lock out the controller connected to the robot.
8.  **Controller Connection:** If a controller is connected to the PC the UI 
    will show this icon. The user can select the icon to disable/enable 
    controller input.

## Remote Controller Connection

If the user has a PS4 controller they can connect it to the UI directly. This 
will allow user drive the UGV the same way as the controller thats connected 
directly to the UGV.  The controller will only function provided the UI window 
is in focus.  Users can also see if other connections have a controller connected
by expanding the User Connections icon as seen below.

## Monitor Wireless Strength

While teleoperating the UGV, the user will notice that the delay between
the time a command is sent and the time it is executed (and/or visible
on the UI camera views) will increase as the distance increases. This
effect will be further amplified by any obstacles between the UGV and
the base (eg. walls, vehicles, mounds, etc.). It is important to monitor
this delay an be cautious when driving the UGV with larger delay for
risk of crashing into obstacles.

When using a Clearpath Robotics UGV and Base Station, the following
hardware setup may be required.

## Calibrating the IMU

Although IMU magnetometers are calibrated at the factory to remove any
internal magnetic influences in the device, measurements are still
subject to influence from external magnetic anomalies when the sensor is
installed. These anomalies are divided into two classes: hard iron
offsets and soft iron distortions. Hard iron offsets are created by
objects that produce a magnetic field. Soft iron distortions are
considered deflections or alterations in the existing magnetic field.
Ideally, these influences are mitigated by installing the sensor away
from magnetic sources, such as coils, magnets, and ferrous metal
structures and mounting hardware. However, often these sources are hard
to avoid or are hidden. To mitigate this effect when using the IMU
magnetometer to aid in heading estimations, a field calibration of the
magnetometer after final installation is highly recommended. This means
that the IMU must be calibrated in the same environment that you use
your UGV for autonomous navigation.

### Microstrain IMU

If your UGV has a 3DM-GX5-25 Microstrain IMU, the complete instruction
on calibration of your IMU can be found in section 5.4 of the
[datasheet](https://www.microstrain.com/sites/default/files/3dm-gx5-25_user_manual_8500-0012.pdf).
Note that you need a computer with Windows system and the LORD Sensing
MIP Hard and Soft Iron Calibration software installed which can be found
at the Microstrain website.

### UM6/7 IMU

If you are using UM6 or UM7 IMUs, you will need the magnetometer display
package which is located at the following address on your UGV:
`~/catkin_ws/Drivers/src/imu_tools/magnetometer_display`.

Follow these steps to calibrate the IMU on your machine:

1.  Create a catkin workspace on your local machine and copy the package
    `magnetometer_display` into your src folder. Build this package with
    the `catkin_make` command.

2.  Perform the following command to make the calibration script
    executable:

    ``` bash
    $ sudo chmod +x calibration.py
    ```

3.  Connect the IMU to your computer and launch the driver. Or if you
    are on the same network as your UGV, make your UGV the ROS master
    and ensure that you can echo the IMU topic on your computer.

4.  Open the `magnetometer.launch` file in the `magnetometer_display`
    package and change the sections shown in the figure below.
    Specifically, set `use_mag_field` to true when the IMU is outputting
    magnetometer measurements with a `sensor_msgs/MagneticField`
    message, otherwise set to false. Microstrain is the only IMU which
    uses the MagneticField message type.

        <figcaption>Magnetometer calibration, general launch settings</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

5.  Launch the calibration using the following command:

    ``` bash
    $ roslaunch magnetometer_display magnetometer.launch
    ```

6.  Move the IMU around to get good coverage. RViz will display
    magnetometer points (red) and will plot current ellipsoid fit
    (green) as shown in the figure below.

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/mag_calib2.png" />
        <figcaption>Magnetometer calibration, ellipsoid fit plot</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

7.  Ellipsoid fit parameters are displayed in terminal as shown in the
    figure below.

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/mag_calib3.png" />
        <figcaption>Magnetometer calibration, ellipsoid fit
        parameters</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

8.  Once there are enough red points on your fitted ellipsoid, enter the
    above calibrations in the IMU driver launch file. Open the
    `sensor.launch` file in the `cpr_gps_localization` package and go to
    the UM7 (or UM6) section of the launch file. The figure below shows
    this section for the UM7.

        <figcaption>Magnetometer calibration, ellipsoid fit settings in launch file</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    You should enter the parameters generated in the Ellipsoid fit step
    as follows (to account for the NED to ENU transform the driver
    applies):

    -   Launch file X = Terminal Y
    -   Launch file Y = Terminal X
    -   Launch file Z = -Terminal Z

## RTK Positioning GPS Setup

:::note

Please skip this section if your robot does not have RTK GPS.

:::

The following configuration is for establishing communications between
the Base Station and the UGV using TCP/IP for the purpose of
transmitting RTK corrections. Before starting this procedure, make sure
that you have installed the [SwiftNav
console](https://support.swiftnav.com/support/solutions/articles/44001903699-installing-swift-console).

is available from SwiftNav.

## RTK Survey Positioning {#base-station-survey}

:::note

Please skip this section if your UGV does not have RTK GPS.

:::

:::warning

Once you have surveyed the location of the Base Station, you **cannot**
relocate the Base Station throughout your tests. Otherwise, this step
has to be repeated.

:::

There are three ways to survey the Base Station location:

1.  OutdoorNav Web User Interface (easiest/accurate),
2.  Swiftnav console autosurvey (fastest/least accurate),
3.  ROS launch file geodetic survey (for debug output display).

Using the OutdoorNav Web UI is the easiest and most accurate way to do
this since it runs the ROS geodetic survey tool which uses more samples
to compute the final position of the Base Station than the Swiftnav
console. Using the geodetic ROS survey launch file directly would allow
the user to visualize the output log directly but requires preliminary
knowledge in ROS.

### Base Station Survey: Web UI

Using the OutdoorNav Web UI to survey the Base Station is very simple.
See [Survey Base Station](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup.mdx#survey_base_station) for details.

### Base Station Survey: Piksi Console

Use the Piksi console connect the base station GPS. Go to "Settings -\>
surveyed position", click to any field in this section and then click
the button on the top right corner "Auto Survey". The figure below
shows these steps. The last 1000 GPS points will be used to compute the
position of the Base Station.

<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/outdoornav_images/autosurvery.png" />
    <figcaption>Auto Survey</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

After that, make sure the four fields in "surveyed position"
(broadcast, surveyed lat, surveyed lon, surveyed alt) are consistent
with your location.

### Base Station Survey: ROS Geodetic Survey

The `ethz_piksi_ros` repository should be installed in the UGV's
`catkin_ws`. To run the surveying process simply connect your PC to the
Base Station network, `ssh` into the UGV's computer and run the
following:

``` bash
roslaunch {robot_name}_gps_navigation geodetic_survey.launch
```

where `robot_name` is either `jackal`, `husky`, or `warthog` depending
on your UGV. The surveying will begin and you will see a running tally
of the collected data.

## RTK Heading Setup

For the rest of this section, it is assumed that a third Swiftnav Duro
device is available with IP address of 192.168.131.32. Note that in
order to change the IP address of a Swiftnav Duro, you need to use the
Swiftnav console and connect to the device with the serial port.

:::note

The instructions in this section will overwrite some of the settings set
in [UGV Position GPS Configuration](#ugv-position-gps-config) on the
Position/Reference Duro receiver. This is normal since the configuration
in [UGV Position GPS Configuration](#ugv-position-gps-config) is for a UGV
with only the position Duro receiver. If the heading receiver is
connected as well, please continue with the instructions below.

:::

The two Swiftnav Duro GPS device on the UGV are connected via serial
cable. They are also both connected via Ethernet cable to the computer
on the UGV. For computing the heading, on Duro (the one on the rear with
IP address 192.168.131.31) operates only to provide GNSS Observations to
the other Duro that computes an RTK derived heading (the Duro on the
front with IP address 192.168.131.32). For the purposes of this
document, we will call the Duro/Piksi that operates to provide the raw
GNSS observations only the "Reference Receiver" and the Duro/Piksi
producing heading measurements the "Attitude Receiver."

Use the Swiftnav console to connect to the Reference Receiver (with IP
address of 192.168.131.31) and insert the settings shown in the figure
below.

Next, connect to the Attitude Receiver (with IP address of
192.168.131.32) and change the configuration as shown in the figure
below.

## Wireless Motion Stop

Please refer to the hardware user manual of the motion stop device for proper
usage. A trained operator should be used to supervise navigation of the
UGV under autonomous control at all times. The Operator should be
familiar with the use of the wireless motion stop device.

While the Web User Interface provides a great way to get started quickly
with OutdoorNav Software, some users will want programmatic control or
may wish to develop their own graphical user interfaces \-- for those
users, the Application Programming Interface (API) provides the
flexibility to do so. This is illustrated in the figure below.

The API is, at present, a [ROS1 Noetic API](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic),
but will soon be extended to a ROS2 API. The API is divided into two
sections, whose details are provided below:

-   [Platform API](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints#topics-platform-api): The set of [ROS
    Topics](http://wiki.ros.org/Topics) are used to comminucate with the
    hardware platform (eg. sensor data, wireless, battery state, command
    velocity). This API can be used by autonomy software packages to
    interface with the hardware platform.
    -   [Topics Published by UGV](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints#topics-published-by-platform):
        The set of topics that are published by the hardware platform.
    -   [Topics Subscribed to by UGV](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints#topics-subscribed-by-platform):
        The set of topics that are subscribed to by the hardware
        platform.
-   [Autonomy API](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints#topics-autonomy-api): The set of [ROS
    Topics](http://wiki.ros.org/Topics) that are used for monitoring and
    controlling the the hardware platform through the OutdoorNav
    autonomy software.
    -   [Topics Published by Autonomy](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints#topics-published-by-autonomy):
        The set of [ROS Topics](http://wiki.ros.org/Topics) published by
        OutdoorNav Software, to be subscribed to by the UGV.
    -   [Topics Subscribed to by Autonomy](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints#topics-subscribed-to-by-autonomy):
        The set of [ROS Topics](http://wiki.ros.org/Topics)
        subscribed to by OutdoorNav Software, typically published by the
        client for directing OutdoorNav operation.
    -   [Services Exported by Autonomy](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints#services-exported-by-autonomy):
        The set of [ROS Services](http://wiki.ros.org/Services) provided
        by OutdoorNav Software, for use by the client to modify/control
        the behaviour of the Autonomy.
    -   [Actions Exported by Autonomy](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints#actions-exported-by-autonomy):
        The set of [ROS Actions](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib) provided
        by OutdoorNav Software, for use by the client to modify/control
        the behaviour of the Autonomy.
-   [Definitions](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints#api-definitions): The set of custom
    [ROS Message](http://wiki.ros.org/Messages), [ROS
    Service](http://wiki.ros.org/Services), and [ROS
    Action](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib) definitions.
-   API Examples: Example code to come.

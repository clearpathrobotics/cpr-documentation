The Mission Scheduler API provides a ROS interface for creating, deleting, editing, and executing missions on a daily
schedule.  Schedules are stored in a database-like structure on-disk, and can be executed manually or automatically.

The web UI is the primary method of creating and modifying schedules, though the ROS API is available should you wish
to write your own interface or create automation tools to interact with the scheduler.

## The Schedule Object

A schedule consists of one or more missions to be executed in the specified order at a particular start time. For
consistency the start time is expressed as a 24-hour time in UTC.

The schedule must be in one of 3 modes:
- `MODE_ONCE` -- the mission is executed exactly once per day, at the indicted UTC time
- `MODE_LOOP` -- the mission is executed a set number of times per day, starting at the indicated UTC time and repeating
  at fixed intervals until the desired number of repetitions is reached
- `MODE_TRANSIENT` -- the mission is run exactly once, and is not saved to the persistent storage. This is intended to
  be used for deferred execution of a mission (e.g. `execute mission X in 5 minutes` would use a transient schedule)

Deleting a mission from the Mission Manager will result in that mission being automatically removed from any schedules
it was part of. If a schedule has no missions it is automatically disabled, and cannot be re-enabled until it contains
at least one mission.

### A Note on Schedule Timing

Automatically-scheduled missions are executed at the provided time +/- 10 seconds.  The duration provided by the
`next_schedule` topic and `get_next_schedule` service is therefore approximate. We recommend rounding the time to the
nearest minute when displaying the countdown information to the user in any sort of GUI.

## Topics Exported by Mission Scheduler

### mission_scheduler/next_schedule

**Message Type:** [cpr_mission_scheduler_msgs/msg/NextSchedule](definitions#scheduler-nextschedule)

**Description:** Publishes the UUID and duration to the next scheduled mission.  If no missions are scheduled the UUID
will be blank.

**Update Rate:** 1Hz

### mission_scheduler/state

**Message Type:** [cpr_mission_scheduler_msgs/msg/StorageState](definitions#scheduler-state)

**Description:** Publishes the current state of the database. Anything that needs to display the current set of
schedules should subscribe to this topic

**Update Rate:** Latched, publishes on state-change only

## Services Exported by Mission Scheduler

### mission_scheduler/add_mission

**Service Type:** [cpr_mission_manager_msgs/srv/AddRemoveById](definitions#storage-addremovebyid)

**Description:** Add a mission to an existing schedule.

### mission_scheduler/clone_schedule

**Service Type:** [cpr_mission_scheduler_msgs/srv/CloneSchedule](definitions#scheduler-cloneschedule)

**Description:** Perform a deep-copy of an existing schedule

### mission_scheduler/create_schedule

**Service Type:** [cpr_mission_scheduler_msgs/srv/CreateSchedule](definitions#scheduler-createschedule)

**Description:** Create a new schedule

### mission_scheduler/delete_all_schedules

**Service Type:** [cpr_mission_manager_msgs/srv/DeleteEverything](definitions#storage-deleteeverything)

**Description:** Delete all schedules.

:::note

This action is permanent and cannot be undone. Use with caution.

:::

### mission_scheduler/delete_schedule

**Service Type:** [cpr_mission_manager_msgs/srv/DeleteById](definitions#storage-deletebyid)

**Description:** Delete a single schedule.

:::note

This action is permanent and cannot be undone. Use with caution.

:::

### mission_scheduler/enable_schedule

**Service Type:** [mission_scheduler/srv/UpdateSchedule](definitions#scheduler-enablechedule)

**Description:** Enable or disable a schedule.

:::note

Disabled schedules can still be run manually with the `run_now` action (see below). Disabled schedules will never
be run automatically.

:::

### mission_scheduler/export

**Service Type:** [cpr_mission_scheduler_msgs/srv/ExportData](definitions#scheduler-exportdata)

**Description:** Export all schedule data to a base64 string to it can be backed-up or copied to another robot.

:::note

This service is intended to be used in combination with the `import_data` service to facilitate backups or
synchronizing schedules across multiple robots.

:::

### mission_scheduler/get_all_schedules

**Service Type:** [mission_scheduler/srv/GetAllSchedules](definitions#scheduler-getallschedules)

**Description:** Get the list of all schedules. The list will include enabled, disabled, and transient schedules.

### mission_scheduler/get_next_schedule

**Service Type:** [mission_scheduler/srv/GetNextSchedule](definitions#scheduler-getnextschedule)

**Description:** Get the UUID of the next schedule that will be run automatically. If nothing is scheduled (e.g. because
there are no enabled schedules) the UUID will be blank.

:::note

The duration is the approximate time left before the schedule will be started automatically.  Schedules will start at
their designated start time +/- 10 seconds.

:::

### mission_scheduler/get_schedule

**Service Type:** [mission_scheduler/srv/GetSchedule](definitions#scheduler-getschedule)

**Description:** Get the schedule with the provided UUID. If an error occurred, or no schedule with the provided UUID
exists, the returned object will have a blank UUID.

### mission_scheduler/import

**Service Type:** [cpr_mission_scheduler_msgs/srv/ImportData](definitions#scheduler-importdata)

**Description:** Import data exported by the `export_data` service.  This will delete all schedules and replace the
database contents with the imported data.

:::note

This service is intended to be used in combination with the `export_data` service to facilitate backups or
synchronizing schedules across multiple robots.

:::

### mission_scheduler/remove_mission

**Service Type:** [cpr_mission_manager_msgs/srv/AddRemoveById](definitions#storage-addremovebyid)

**Description:** Remove the mission at a given position from a schedule, or remove all copies of a mission from a
schedule

### mission_scheduler/update_schedule

**Service Type:** [mission_scheduler/srv/UpdateSchedule](definitions#scheduler-updateschedule)

**Description:** Modify an existing schedule. All of the schedule's properties are overwritten with the new values
provided in the service call.

:::note

Before modifying a schedule it is recommended to call the `get_schedule` service to get the schedule's current state,
copy all values to the service request object, and then change the fields you want to overwrite.

## Actions Exported by Mission Scheduler

### mission_scheduler/run_now

**Action Type:** [cpr_mission_scheduler_msgs/action/RunScheduleByUuid](definitions#scheduler-runschedulebyuuid)

**Description:** Execute the schedule with the given UUID. The `delay` parameter will defer the execution by the
specified time.  This action can be used to run a disabled schedule, or run a schedule at a time other than its
scheduled start time.

**Feedback Rate:** 1Hz

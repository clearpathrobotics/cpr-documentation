## The Code

```python
#! /usr/bin/env python3

from cpr_outdoornav_api_examples_lib.ros_node import RosNode
from cpr_outdoornav_api_examples_lib.yaml_config import YamlConfig
import time
import os

# The file containing the mission configuration (adjust as needed)
MISSION_YAML_FILE = os.environ.get("HOME", "administrator") + "/example_ws/src/" + \
                   "CPR-OutdoorNav/src/cpr_outdoornav_api_examples/config/sample_mission.yaml"

class MissionFromYamlFile(RosNode):
    """
    Create and run a mission loaded from a YAML configuration file.
    Be sure that your robot is within 3 meters of your first Waypoint prior to starting the mission.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the mission details and server connection."""

        RosNode.__init__(self, 'mission_from_yaml_file')
        self.mission = YamlConfig.yamlFileToMission(MISSION_YAML_FILE)

        # NOTE: to save the configuration to file, uncomment the following lines:
        # YamlConfig.missionToYamlFile('/tmp/test1.yaml', self.mission)

    def run(self):
        """Execute the mission."""

        if not self.mission.startMission():
            return False
        while not self.mission.isMissionComplete():
            time.sleep(1.0)
        return self.mission.getMissionSuccess()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    if MissionFromYamlFile().run():
        print("Mission completed successfully")
    else:
        print("Mission failed")

```

## The Code Explained

Let's break down the code.

```python
#! /usr/bin/env python3
```

Every Python ROS Node will have this declaration at the top. The first line makes sure your script is executed as a Python3 script.

```python
from cpr_outdoornav_api_examples_lib.ros_node import RosNode
from cpr_outdoornav_api_examples_lib.yaml_config import YamlConfig
```

We provide a library of classes that can be used within your file for ease of use. In the above example, we import the RosNode and YamlConfig classes.
The RosNode class is used by all of our examples to initialize a ROS node that will execute the example mission. The YamlConfig class is used to import
a YAML file and convert it to a Mission object.

```python
MISSION_YAML_FILE = os.environ.get("HOME", "administrator") + "/example_ws/src/" + \
                   "CPR-OutdoorNav/src/cpr_outdoornav_api_examples/config/sample_mission.yaml"
```

This defines the file path of the YAML file that contains the mission to be executed. See the [YAML file](#yaml-file) below for the example YAML file
that will be executed.

```python
class MissionFromYamlFile(RosNode):
```

Creates a class for your example, which inherits a RosNode object. All python mission files are requried to inherit the RosNode class.

````python
        RosNode.__init__(self, 'mission_from_yaml_file')
        self.mission = YamlConfig.yamlFileToMission(MISSION_YAML_FILE)```
````

Initialize the ROS node with name `mission_from_yaml_file` and import the the mission from the yaml config file. The `YamlConfig.yamlFileToMission()` function
reads teh configuration you have created in the YAML file and converts it into a Mission object.

```python
        if not self.mission.startMission():
            return False
```

Upon execution of the script, the `self.mission.startMission()` function creates the mission client if not yet created, connects to the mission action server
and sends the goal to the action server to begin the execution of the mission.

```python
        while not self.mission.isMissionComplete():
            time.sleep(1.0)
        return self.mission.getMissionSuccess()
```

`self.mission.isMissionComplete()` monitors the mission status and only proceeds to terminating the mission has completed or been cancelled.

## YAML File {#yaml-file}

The following YAML file is used in the above example mission.

```python

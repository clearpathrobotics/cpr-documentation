The OutdoorNav API examples are now available and accesible to everyone. A
[Python API library](https://github.com/cpr-application/clearpath_onav_examples) along
with some example scripts are available to build and use for our application.

A few examples scripts follow with detailed explanations:

- [Execute Mission from File](./mission_from_file.mdx)
- [Execute Mission with Custom Task](./mission_with_custom_tasks.mdx)
- [Status Monitoring](./monitor_status.mdx)
- [Network of Paths](./network_of_paths.mdx)

The documentation for the Python API library can be built following the
instructions in the above linked GitHub repository.

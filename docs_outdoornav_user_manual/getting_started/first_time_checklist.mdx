## Hardware Setup

### ☐ Has the Base Station been set up?

Ensure that the Base Station has been set up approximately 5 meters
away from any buildings and is currently powered on. See
[System Startup](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup) for further
instructions related to setting up the Base Station.

### ☐ Is the UGV connected to the Base Station?

Check to see that the UGV can be pinged from the Base Station network.
See [Connecting to Web UI](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup#connecting_to_web_ui) for further
details.

## Software Setup

### ☐ Is ROS running on the UGV?

SSH into the UGV and run `rostopic list` to generate a list of the
rostopics that are currently available. The list is generally fairly
long so if you are looking for any specific topic please refer to
[API Endpoints](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/api/api_endpoints). You can also check the
ROS status through the OutdoorNAV UI by selecting the ROS icon next to
the POS/DIR icons.

### ☐ Is the OutdoorNAV software running?

Check to see if the relevant dockers are running (ssh into the UGV and
run `docker ps` which should show 4 separate docker containers
running.)

### ☐ Is the computer using the UI connected to the Base Station network?

This can be confirmed by following the steps found in
[Connecting to Web UI](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup#connecting_to_web_ui).

### ☐ Have you surveyed the Base Station?

See [RTK Survey Positioning](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/cpr_hardware#base-station-survey) for
information on how and when to survey the Base station.

### ☐ Do you have a strong GPS signal?

After surveying the Base Station check the upper right hand corner of
the UI to confirm that you have a strong GPS signal (the POS and DIR
icons should be green). If either of these icons are not green refer
to [Checking GPS RTK Fix](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup#checking-gpt-rtk-fix) for further
troubleshooting information.

### ☐ Is the map loading correctly?

Currently the map requires internet access to load. Refer to
[Loading Map Tiles](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup#loading_map_tiles) for more details
related to setting up the map.

### ☐ Has the Datum been set?

See [Set Datum](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup#set-datum) for information on how
to set the Datum variables.

### ☐ If docking is enabled has the location been set?

If the Clearpath Robotics autonomous docking package was purchased the
docking location will need to be set. See
[Set Dock Location](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup#set-dock-location) for information on
how to set the docking location.

### ☐ Is the Navbar status icon functioning?

To check if the Navbar icon is functioning, trigger the UGV\'s e-stop
and check to see if it has turned to a red icon. Clicking the icon
will bring up the status information as well as any recent messages
(see below).

## Using the UI

The following items are general checks to ensure that the UI is working
properly.

### ☐ Can the virtual joystick drive the UGV?

See [Web UI Manual Mode](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_manual_mode) for further details
related to this.

### ☐ Can you create a new mission?

Select the mission list and then click on `Add Mission` to create a
new mission. To add new waypoints/goals for the mission refer to
[Goal Creation](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_autonomous_mode#goal-creation).

### ☐ After creating a new mission, can you execute the mission?

To execute a mission refer to [Mission Execution](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_autonomous_mode#mission-execution).

### ☐ Are the cameras (if present) active in the view bar section when running the mission?

For more information related to camera views see
[Camera Views](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_overview#camera-views).

### ☐ Can you select a camera and save an image after it loads on the main screen?

See [Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) View ](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_overview#ptz-view) for more details related
to saving images.

By default, the OutdoorNav Software begins automatically when the system
is powered on. This section outlines the OutdoorNav Command Line Interface (CLI),
the set of commands that can be used by developers who are debugging
the system or who want more precise control for managing the OutdoorNav
software.

## Connecting to the OutdoorNav Computer {#connecting-to-outdoornav-computer}

To connect to your UGV, consult its corresponding user manual.

If you are using a Clearpath Robotics UGV with a separate OutdoorNav Computer,
first `ssh` to the UGV using the details provided in the UGV user
manual. Then, if a separate OutdoorNav Computer exists, you can
connect to it by running:

``` bash
ssh administrator@192.168.131.5
```

## OutdoorNav CLI Installation

The OutdoorNav CLI is pre-installed on Clearpath robots. If it has not
been installed on your system, it can be installed by running the following
on the OutdoorNav Computer:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-onav-cli
```

:::note

The command above requires that the Clearpath Package Server has been
configured on your OutdoorNav Computer. This is pre-configured on
Clearpath robots. Refer to details on the
[Clearpath Package Server](http://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/) if
this is not configured on your computer.

:::

## Listing the OutdoorNav CLI Commands and Getting Help

To list all of the CLI commands, run the following on the OutdoorNav Computer:

```bash
onav help
```

The CLI commands are:

-  `install`: Download and configure OutdoorNav
-  `key`: Get, set, or delete your OutdoorNav license key
-  `download`: Download OutdoorNav, but do not configure it
-  `configure`: (Re)configure OutdoorNav
-  `upgrade`: Upgrade OutdoorNav to the latest vesion
-  `uninstall`: Uninstall OutdoorNav
-  `depends`: Verify and install dependencies
-  `start`: Start OutdoorNav
-  `stop`: Stop OutdoorNav
-  `status`: Check the status of OutdoorNav
-  `logs`: View OutdoorNav logs
-  `versions`: Print versions available to install
-  `help`: Show available commands

To get help on an individual command, use the `-h` option. For example, to
get help on the `install` command, run `onav install -h`:

```
usage: onav install [-h] [-k KEY] [-b] [-c] [-H] VERSION

positional arguments:
  VERSION               The OutdoorNav version to install (e.g. 0.11.0)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k KEY, --key KEY     Your OutdoorNav installation key
  -b, --backpack        Configure in backpack/bridged mode
  -c, --clean           Clean any configurations from a prior installation
```

## Starting and Stopping the OutdoorNav Software {#starting-outdoornav}

On UGV startup, all the sensors, the user interface, as well as the
autonomy software are set to start automatically. When debugging or when
greater control is desired, the CLI can be used to start and stop
the OutdoorNav software, in whole or in part.

To see the current status of OutdoorNav software, run:

```bash
onav status
```

To start the OutdoorNav software if it is not running, use the following command,
which starts the latest version of the software by default:

```bash
onav start
```

To stop the OutdoorNav software, run:

```bash
onav stop
```

## Stopping and Restarting the Autonomy Software Only

To use the UGV without the autonomy software, use the following
command to stop the nodes and prevent them from automatic startup:

``` bash
onav stop -s autonomy
```

The autonomy software can be restarted by running:

``` bash
onav start -s autonomy
```

## Stopping/Restarting the Sensors

To use the UGV without the sensors, use these commands to disable the
nodes and prevent them from automatic startup:

``` bash
onav stop -s sensors
```

:::note

This command will only disable the drivers for the sensors that are started
by the OutdoorNav software. This includes the GNSS units, the Microstrain IMU,
and any LiDAR/Stereo detection sources (not limited to Velodyne LiDARs, Realsense
cameras, 2D Lidars).

:::

The sensors software can be restarted by running:

```
onav start -s sensors
```

## Accessing the OutdoorNav Software Logs

To check the logs of the OutdoorNav software, use the `onav logs` command
with the appropriate service. For example, to view the logs for the sensors
service, run:

```bash
onav logs sensors
```

## Installing the OutdoorNav Software

OutdoorNav is typically pre-installed on Clearpath robots, so most users should
not need to do a first-time installation of the software, though the process
is outlined below as a reference.

As a first step, confirm that the robot has internet access. For example, confirm
that the following command is successful:

```
ping 8.8.8.8
```

Second, the required dependencies need to be installed by running:

```bash
onav depends
```

Third, a key needs to be added onto the robot to enable the installation
process. Contact [Clearpath Support](../support) if you did not receive your key.
To add your key, run the following, replacing `<YOUR_KEY>` with the actual value:

```bash
onav key <YOUR_KEY>
```

Fourth, list the versions available for installation by running:

```bash
onav versions
```

Fifth, install the OutdoorNav software for the desired version (typically the
newest version), by running the following, replacing `<TARGET_VERSION>` with
the version to be installed:

```bash
onav install <TARGET_VERSION>
```

When prompted, trigger the reboot.

Finally, following the reboot, run the following command to start the OutdoorNav
software. This will only be required the first time after installation.

```bash
onav start <TARGET_VERSION>
```

## Upgrading the OutdoorNav Software

After receiving a notice that a new version of the OutdoorNav Software is
available, use the `onav install` command with the appropriate version.
Note that `onav install` runs the following commands in sequence:

-  `onav download`
-  `onav configure`
-  `onav upgrade`

For example, to upgrade from 0.11.0 to 0.12.0, run the following command:

```
onav install 0.12.0
```

:::note

The `download` step requires internet access to download the new software.
Confirm that the OutdoorNav Computer has internet access by running a command
such as:

```
ping 8.8.8.8
```

:::

## Uninstalling Old Versions of OutdoorNav Software

If old versions of OutdoorNav software are no longer being used, they can
be removed with the `onav uninstall` command. For example, to uninstall 0.11.0
run:

```
onav uninstall 0.11.0
```

## Command Line Operation

By default the OutdoorNav Software, including the Navigation component,
begins automatically when the system is powered on. This section
outlines the commands that can be used by developers who are debugging
the system or who want more precise control for managing the Navigation
component.

### Connecting to the OutdoorNav Computer {#connecting-to-outdoornav-computer}

To connect to your UGV, consult its corresponding user manual.

If you are using a Clearpath Robotics UGV with an OutdoorNav computer,
first `ssh` to the UGV using the details provided in the UGV user
manual. If you have a wired connection to the Clearpath Robotics UGV,
use the following command. If using wifi, you can replace the IP address
with the wifi-assigned IP address or the hostname of the UGV.

``` bash
ssh administrator@192.168.131.1
```

Then, connect to the OutdoorNav Computer:

``` bash
ssh administrator@192.168.131.5
```

### Starting the Navigation Software {#starting-outdoornav}

Begin by connecting to the OutdoorNav Computer as outlined above.

On UGV startup, all the sensors, the user interface, as well as the
Navigation software are set to start automatically through a Docker
container. You can check the Docker container's status by running
`docker compose ps` and checking for:

-   onav-web (Docker image containing the web interface)
-   onav-web-ros (Docker image containing the ROS web bridge nodes)
-   onav-sensors (Docker image containing that launches the ROS sensor
    drivers)
-   onav-autonomy (Docker image containing the ROS nodes related to the
    autonomy)

If the Docker containers are not running, they can be started with:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav up -d
```

### Stopping/Restarting all of OutdoorNav

To use the UGV without the OutdoorNav software, use these commands to
stop the software and prevent it from automatic startup:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav stop
```

If the OutdoorNav software is currently running or has been stopped, it
can be restarted by running:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav start
```

### Stopping/Restarting the Autonomy

To use the UGV without the autonomy core of OutdoorNav, use these
commands to stop the nodes and prevent them from automatic startup:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile autonomy stop
```

The autonomy core can be restarted by running:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav start
```

### Stopping/Restarting the Sensors

To use the UGV without the sensors, use these commands to disable the
nodes and prevent them from automatic startup:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose stop
```

### Accessing the Shell in Docker Container

To access the shell in a Docker container for debugging (optionally
replace `onav-autonomy` with `onav-web` in the following command):

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/      # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose exec -it onav-autonomy bash
```

### Accessing the Navigation Software Logs

To check the logs of the Navigation software:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # The directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose logs -f
```

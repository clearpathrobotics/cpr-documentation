## Command Line Operation

By default the OutdoorNav Software, including the Navigation component,
begins automatically when the system is powered on. This section
outlines the commands that can be used by developers who are debugging
the system or who want more precise control for managing the Navigation
component.

### Connecting to the OutdoorNav Computer {#connecting-to-outdoornav-computer}

To connect to your UGV, consult its corresponding user manual.

If you are using a Clearpath Robotics UGV with a seperate OutdoorNav computer,
first `ssh` to the UGV using the details provided in the UGV user
manual. If you have a wired connection to the Clearpath Robotics UGV,
use the following command. If using wifi, you can replace the IP address
with the wifi-assigned IP address or the hostname of the UGV.

``` bash
ssh administrator@192.168.131.1
```

Then, connect to the OutdoorNav Computer:

``` bash
ssh administrator@192.168.131.5
```

### Starting the Navigation Software {#starting-outdoornav}

Begin by connecting to the OutdoorNav Computer as outlined above.

On UGV startup, all the sensors, the user interface, as well as the
Navigation software are set to start automatically through a Docker
container. You can check the Docker container's status by running
`docker ps` and checking for:

-   onav-web (Docker image containing the web interface)
-   onav-web-ros (Docker image containing the ROS web bridge nodes)
-   onav-sensors (Docker image that launches the ROS sensor drivers)
-   onav-power (Docker image that launches the ROS nodes related to 
    the power system of the UGV)
-   onav-autonomy (Docker image that launches the ROS nodes related 
    to the autonomy)

The docker compose file located at `~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/docker-compose.yml`
provides the description for each the docker images that are being generated
on startup. In here, you can find that there are profiles set up as part of the
docker compose structure. They are:

-   ui: starts the onav-web and onav-web-ros containers
-   sensors: starts the onav-sensors container
-   power: starts the onav-power container
-   autonomy: starts the onav-autonomy container
-   outdoornav: starts all of the containers
-   teleop: start only the ui and sensor related containers (no autonomy)

If the Docker containers are not running, they can all be started with:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav up -d
```

### Stopping/Restarting all of OutdoorNav

Each individual profile can also be brought down. For example to use the UGV without
the OutdoorNav software. The following command brings down OutdoorNav and is persistent
accross reboots/power cylces.

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav down
```

If the OutdoorNav software has been brought down, it can be restarted by running:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav up -d
```

### Stopping/Restarting the Autonomy

To use the UGV without the autonomy core of OutdoorNav, use these
commands to stop the nodes and prevent them from automatic startup:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile autonomy down
```

The autonomy core can be restarted by running:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile autonomy up -d
```

### Stopping/Restarting the Sensors

To use the UGV without the sensors, use these commands to disable the
nodes and prevent them from automatic startup:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile sensors down
```

::: note

This command will only disable the drivers for the sensors that are started
by the OutdoorNv software. This includes the GNSS units, the Microstrain IMU,
and any LiDAR/Stereo detection sources (not limited to Velodyne LiDARs, Realsense
cameras, 2D Lidars)

### Accessing the Navigation Software Logs

To check the logs of the Navigation software:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # The directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose logs -f
```

Optionally, specify the specific container you would like to view logs for:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # The directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose logs -f onav-autonomy
```

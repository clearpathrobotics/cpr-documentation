:::note

Sensor TF validation should only be required if the performance is
noticeably poor, such as when the UGV drifts off of the planned path or
oscillations occur around the path).

The coordinate transformation of the two GPS antennas, the IMU, the 2D
and 3D Lidars to the base_link of the UGV should have already been set
prior to receiving the UGV. However, ensure that they are set correctly.

The ROS coordinate frame base_link, shown in the figure below, is
located at the center of the bottom plate of the UGV. The environment
variables below should be taken with respect to this coordinate frame.
The X axis is in red (and pointing towards the front of the UGV), Y in
green (pointing towards the left of the UGV) and Z in blue (pointing
towards the sky).

You can check the current value of the environment variables by running
the following (and setting <variable_name\> to the names listed in the
table below).

``` bash
printenv | grep <variable_name>
```

The environment variables for the position and orientation of each
sensor are provided in the table below.

_OutdoorNav sensor position and orientation environment variables_

| Environment Variable | Function                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| POSITION_GPS_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the position (rear) GPS antenna with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| POSITION_GPS_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the position (rear) GPS antenna with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| HEADING_GPS_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the heading (front) GPS antenna with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| HEADING_GPS_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the heading (front) GPS antenna with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| MICROSTRAIN_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the IMU with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| MICROSTRAIN_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the IMU with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| LIDAR_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the 3D Lidar with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| LIDAR_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the 3D Lidar with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| LASER_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the 2D Lidar with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| LASER_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the 2D Lidar with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |

:::note

When the printed Y axis on the IMU is pointing towards the front of the
robot (i.e., aligned to X axis of base_link), MICROSTRAIN_RPY = [0, 0, 0].

:::warning

If you decide to move any of these sensors, you must modify these
variables accordingly.

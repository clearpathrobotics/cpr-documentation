## Summary

OutdoorNav Software is a software package developed by Clearpath
Robotics for autonomous and manual navigation of Unmanned Ground
Vehicles (UGVs) in outdoor environments.

## Compatible Platforms

While it has been optimized for use with OutdoorNav Hardware from
Clearpath Robotics
([Husky](https://clearpathrobotics.com/husky-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/),
[Jackal](https://clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/),
and
[Warthog](https://clearpathrobotics.com/warthog-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/)),
it has been designed so that it can be added easily to third-party UGVs.

## Key Features

Key features of OutdoorNav Software include:

-   Mission Planning and Autonomous Navigation

    -   Robust GPS-based localization with sensor fusion of IMU, LiDAR
        and platform odometry
    -   Autonomous path following via waypoints
    -   Obstacle Detection and Avoidance: Stop and wait or
        autonomously plan a collision-free path around obstacles
        without the need to stop

-   Teleoperation

    -   Operate the robot remotely using an on-screen or physical
        joystick
    -   Visualize what the robot sees by displaying its network
        cameras and LiDAR data

-   Web User Interface (Web UI)

    -   Build missions containing sets of paths, with optional task
        execution on each path; tasks can be standard tasks (eg. save
        camera image) or user provided functions
    -   View the robot's live position and attitude on the map
    -   Display robot data such as velocity, signal strength, status
        of the motion stop, status of navigation system, and battery charge
    -   Save and export Missions

-   Application Programming Interface (API)

    -   Build your own application and UI by accessing the navigation
        API to control the UGV through software or implement fleet
        management by accessing the mission API

-   Simulation

    -   Begin development of your application prior to purchasing
        licenses or commissioning hardware with OutdoorNav software and
        the ROS Gazebo simulator

-   Third Party Integration

    -   The Web UI and API can be accessed through a network connection;
        cloud-based services are available from third parties to
        facilitate remote connections and networking to robot hardware
        such as Formant.io and Freedom Robotics

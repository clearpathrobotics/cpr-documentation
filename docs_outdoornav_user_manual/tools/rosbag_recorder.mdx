If you need to perform a quick rosbag recording from the UI you can do
so by navigating to the Settings dropdown in the upper left hand menu and
select **Start rosbag recording**. This will record a rosbag of the
following topics (or all the topics in the namespace if followed by a
`/*`):

- '/rosout_agg/(.\*)'
- '/rosout'
- '/twist_marker_server/(.\*)'
- '/autonomy/(.\*)'
- '/dock/(.\*)'
- '/laser_target_tracker/(.\*)'
- '/localization/(.\*)'
- '/localization_core/(.\*)'
- '/localization_helper/(.\*)'
- '/mission/(.\*)'
- '/navigation/(.\*)'
- '/onboard_systems/(.\*)'
- '/platform/(.\*)'
- '/swiftnav/(.\*)'
- '/sensors/gps(.\*)'
- '/sensors/imu(.\*)'
- '/target/(.\*)'
- '/tf(.\*)'

To stop the recording navigate to the Settings drop down and select
**Stop rosbag recording**. This will save the rosbag with the date and
time as its file name in the `/opt/onav/saved_files/rosbags/` directory.

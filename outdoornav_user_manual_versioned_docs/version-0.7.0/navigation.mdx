## Features

The OutdoorNav Software contains a set of features that can be enabled
or disabled according to your required application requirements. These
features can be enabled or disabled through the use of environment
variables, which should be added to the
`/home/administrator/cpr_outdoornav_launch/outdoornav_tuning.env`. The
following table describes the available features, their default state
and any additional parameters that we expose that may also be included
to tune the feature.

| Feature     | Description                                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Data Collection**         | The data collection feature enabled the user to record rosbag data of the sensors, localization, and  navigation components of OutdoorNav. If `true`,  rosbags will be saved and timestamed in the `/home/administrator/onav_log/rosbag_data/` directory. If `false`, no rosbag will be recorded.<br/><br/>Environment Variable: `ENABLE_BAGGING` (Default: `false`). |
| **Collision Avoidance**     | Collision avoidance is the UGV's ability to detect obstacles and stop/maneuver around the obstacle without any collisions. If `true`, the UGV will detect obstacles and if `false` no obstacles will be detected. Setting to `false` is not recommended and may cause harm to property or to individuals.<br/><br/>Environment Variable: `ENABLE_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE` (Default: `true`). |
| **Obstacle Avoidance Mode** | When collision avoidance is enabled, the UGV will behave in one of two ways according to the obstacle avoidance mode. If set to `true`, the UGV will perform obstacle avoidance maneuvers, replanning around detected obstacles. If set to `false`, the UGV will slow down to a stop in front of detected obstacles and wait for the obstacle to clear before proceeding.<br/><br/>Environment Variable: `OBSTACLE_AVOIDANCE_MODE` (Default: `true`). |
| **Continuous Planning**     | The continuous planning feature allows the UGV to continuously monitor whether an obstacle is on the UGV's path and replan around said obstacle smoothly without the need for stopping in front of the obstacle. If disabled, the UGV will come to a full stop in front of an obstacle and then replan around said obstacle.<br/><br/>Environment Variable: `ENABLE_CONTINUOUS_PLANNER` (Default: `true`). |
| **Path Smoothing**          | The path smoothing feature according to a specified turning radius. The default behaviour will generate point-to-point straight line paths.<br/><br/>Environment Variable: `ENABLE_PATH_SMOOTHER` (Default: `false`). |
| **Path Shifting**           | The path shifting feature is designed to reduce the oscillation around the initial reference path if the UGV begins to deviate of said reference path. It is particularly useful for the Clearpath Robotics Warthog platform whose tires are incredibly pliable and results in unmodelled effects on the navigation.<br/><br/>Environment Variable: `ENABLE_PATH_SHIFTING` (Default: `false`). |
| **Constrained Replanning**  | The constrained replanning feature restricts the area in which replanning paths can be generated. For example, if a `REPLANNING_CONSTRAINT` of 3.0 m is used, the UGV will not be allowed to replan a path that drives it more than 3.0 m from the initial path. This replanning area can be shown on the map over the connecting lines between waypoints. See [Constrained Replanning](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_autonomous_mode#constrained_path) for further details.<br/><br/>Environment Variable: `ENABLE_CONSTRAINED_REPLANNING` (Default: `false`).<br/><br/>Use the `REPLANNING_CONSTRAINT` environment variable to modify the replanning constraint (in meters). |
| **Stop Distance**           | The stop distance feature allows the UGV to stop a predefined distance away from obstacles. This is useful if a UGV cannot drive in reverse and needs the required room in front of it to replan around an obstacle.<br/><br/>Environment Variable: `ENABLE_STOP_DISTANCE` (Default: `false`)<br/><br/>Use the `STOP_DISTANCE` environment variable to modify the stop distance (in meters). Note that if the stop distance is larger than 4.5 meters for the Clearpath Robotics Jackal and Husky UGVs, or 10.0 meters for the Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV, the computational load will increase and may cause a decrease in performance in the navigation. |
| **Delay Compensation**      | The delay compensation feature is able to compensate for mechanical delay on UGVs where either the accelerator introduces delay into the linear velocity or the steering introduces delay in the angular velocity. This feature is not required for Clearpath Robotics UGVs as negligible delay is present in our system.<br/><br/>Environment Variable: `ENABLE_DELAY_COMPENSATION` (Default: `false`)<br/><br/>Use the `CONTROLLER_DELAY` environment variable to modify the amount of delay to be compensated (in milliseconds). |

of the navigation inputs of to the OutdoorNav autonomy. It is
recommended that you first consult the following link(s) before
attempting to modify these parameters.

-   [Costmap2D/ObstacleLayer](http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d/hydro/obstacles)

## Command Line Operation

By default the OutdoorNav Software, including the Navigation component,
begins automatically when the system is powered on. This section
outlines the commands that can be used by developers who are debugging
the system or who want more precise control for managing the Navigation
component.

### Connecting to the OutdoorNav Computer {#connecting-to-outdoornav-computer}

To connect to your UGV, consult its corresponding user manual.

If you are using a Clearpath Robotics UGV with an OutdoorNav computer,
first `ssh` to the UGV using the details provided in the UGV user
manual. If you have a wired connection to the Clearpath Robotics UGV,
use the following command. If using wifi, you can replace the IP address
with the wifi-assigned IP address or the hostname of the UGV.

``` bash
ssh administrator@192.168.131.1
```

Then, connect to the OutdoorNav Computer:

``` bash
ssh administrator@192.168.131.100
```

### Starting the Navigation Software {#starting-outdoornav}

Begin by connecting to the OutdoorNav Computer as outlined above.

On UGV startup, all the sensors, the user interface, as well as the
Navigation software are set to start automatically through a Docker
container. You can check the Docker container's status by running
`docker compose ps` and checking for:

-   onav-web (Docker image containing the web interface)
-   onav-web-ros (Docker image containing the ROS web bridge nodes)
-   onav-sensors (Docker image containing that launches the ROS sensor
    drivers)
-   onav-autonomy (Docker image containing the ROS nodes related to the
    autonomy)

If the Docker containers are not running, they can be started with:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav up -d
```

### Stopping/Restarting all of OutdoorNav

To use the UGV without the OutdoorNav software, use these commands to
stop the software and prevent it from automatic startup:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav stop
```

If the OutdoorNav software is currently running or has been stopped, it
can be restarted by running:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav start
```

### Stopping/Restarting the Autonomy

To use the UGV without the autonomy core of OutdoorNav, use these
commands to stop the nodes and prevent them from automatic startup:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile autonomy stop
```

The autonomy core can be restarted by running:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav start
```

### Stopping/Restarting the Sensors

To use the UGV without the sensors, use these commands to disable the
nodes and prevent them from automatic startup:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose stop
```

### Accessing the Shell in Docker Container

To access the shell in a Docker container for debugging (optionally
replace `onav-autonomy` with `onav-web` in the following command):

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/      # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose exec -it onav-autonomy bash
```

### Accessing the Navigation Software Logs

To check the logs of the Navigation software:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # The directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose logs -f
```

### Validating TF Setup

:::note

Sensor TF validation should only be required if the performance is
noticeably poor, such as when the UGV drifts off of the planned path or
oscillations occur around the path).

:::

The coordinate transformation of the two GPS antennas, the IMU, the 2D
and 3D Lidars to the base_link of the UGV should have already been set
prior to receiving the UGV. However, ensure that they are set correctly.

The ROS coordinate frame base_link, shown in the figure below, is
located at the center of the bottom plate of the UGV. The environment
variables below should be taken with respect to this coordinate frame.
The X axis is in red (and pointing towards the front of the UGV), Y in
green (pointing towards the left of the UGV) and Z in blue (pointing
towards the sky).

You can check the current value of the environment variables by running
the following (and setting <variable_name\> to the names listed in the
table below).

``` bash
printenv | grep <variable_name>
```

The environment variables for the position and orientation of each
sensor are provided in the table below.

_GPS Navigation sensor position and orientation environment variables_

| Environment Variable | Function                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| POSITION_GPS_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the position (rear) GPS antenna with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| POSITION_GPS_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the position (rear) GPS antenna with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| HEADING_GPS_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the heading (front) GPS antenna with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| HEADING_GPS_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the heading (front) GPS antenna with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| MICROSTRAIN_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the IMU with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| MICROSTRAIN_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the IMU with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| LIDAR_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the 3D Lidar with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| LIDAR_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the 3D Lidar with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| LASER_XYZ | [X,Y,Z] position, in meters, of the 2D Lidar with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |
| LASER_RPY | [Roll,Pitch,Yaw], in radians, of the 2D Lidar with respect to the base_link coordinate frame. |

:::note

When the printed Y axis on the IMU is pointing towards the front of the
robot (i.e., aligned to X axis of base_link), MICROSTRAIN_RPY = [0, 0, 0].

:::warning

If you decide to move any of these sensors, you must modify these
variables accordingly.

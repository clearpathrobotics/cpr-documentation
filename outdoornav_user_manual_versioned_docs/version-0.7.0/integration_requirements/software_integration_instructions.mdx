Prior to installing the OutdoorNav software, ensure that you have completed the relevant [Hardware Kit Checklist](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/integration_requirements/hardware_integration_requirements). If installing on a secondary/backpack/Starter Kit computer, ensure to have also completed the:
- [Interface Control Checklist](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/integration_requirements/interface_control_requirements)

All the following instructions, unless otherwise specified, are to be run on the OutdoorNav computer.

### Clone OutdoorNav Repository {#clone-install-repo}

The following repository is required to run the instructions in the subsequent sections.

``` bash
cd ~/
git clone -b 0.7.0 https://gitlab.clearpathrobotics.com/cpr-outdoornav/cpr_outdoornav_launch.git
```

For remote installations, please contact Clearpath Robotics customer support in order to obtain the relevant information required to proceed.

### Install Docker {#install-docker}

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/scripts/
./install_docker.sh
```

### Configure OutdoorNav Sensors {#configure-outdoornav-sensors}

Prior to configuring the sensors, ensure that you have measured the position (XYZ) and orientation (RPY) of each of your sensors with respect to the `base_link`. See your results from the [Integration Requirements](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/integration_requirements/hardware_integration_requirements).

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/scripts/
./configure_outdoornav.sh
```

### Finalize Setup {#final-setup}

The script in the sections below will reboot the computer it is run on.

##### Platform Computer

For installations of the OutdoorNav software on the platform computer (not a secondary or Starter Kit computer), run the following:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/
pushd scripts
sudo ./setup_computers.sh
```
##### Secondary or Starter Kit Computer

Prior to running the script on the secondary or Starter Kit computer, ensure that you have the user and IP of the platform computer that the secondary/starter kit computer is connected to. Run the following:

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/
pushd scripts
sudo ./setup_computers.sh -b
```

### Install OutdoorNav Software {#install-outdoornav}

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/scripts/
docker compose --profile outdoornav pull
```

:::note
If you are installing the OutdoorNav software on a secondary or Starter Kit computer, you must also complete the [Platform Computer Checklist](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/integration_requirements/platform_computer_checklist)
:::

### Configure Platform Footprint {#configure-platform-footprint}

If the platform has sensors and/or parts that protrude outside of the platform body, then a few environment variables will need to be modified to adjust the footprint of the robot. Things that could be extending past the footprint could include but are not limited to:

-   GPS antennae,
-   Charging receivers,
-   Arms,
-   etc...

Change the environment variables from the Table below, in the following file:

```
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch
nano outdoornav_tuning.env
```

| Environment Variable        | Description                            | Default |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| **FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_POS_X**  | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the front of the robot | 0.5   |
| **FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_NEG_X**  | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the rear of the robot  | -0.5  |
| **FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_POS_Y**  | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the left of the robot  | 0.35  |
| **FOOTPRINT_OFFSET_NEG_Y**  | Distance from base_link to the furthest edge of any part/sensor at the right of the robot | -0.35 |



### Start OutdoorNav

``` bash
cd ~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/    # directory with docker-compose.yaml
docker compose --profile outdoornav up -d
```

### Test OutdoorNav Installation

1. Ping all of the network sensors to ensure proper communication with the platform or secondary computer.

2. Check the following topics and make sure there is data being published to them:

``` bash
rostopic echo -n 1 /platform/odom
rostopic echo -n 1 /platform/cmd_vel
 
# IMU 1 (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/imu/0/data
 
rostopic echo -n 1 /localization/odom
 
# Velodyne 1 (if included)
rostopic echo /sensors/lidar/0/pointcloud
 
# Velodyne 2 (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/lidar/1/pointcloud
 
# Laser Scan Front (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/lidar/0/scan
 
# Laser Scan Rear (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/lidar/1/scan
 
# Realsense D435 Front (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/stereo/0/pointcloud
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/stereo/0/depth/image_rect_raw
 
# Realsense D435 Rear (if included)
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/stereo/1/pointcloud
rostopic echo -n 1 /sensors/stereo/1/depth/image_rect_raw
```

Once installation is complete, you can proceed to [Getting Started](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup) to start using the software.

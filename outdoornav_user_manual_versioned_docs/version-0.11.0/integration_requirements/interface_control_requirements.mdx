## ROS Interface Control Checklist

Prior to the installation and tuning of Clearpath Robotics (CPR)
OutdoorNav software on your platform (robot computer), CPR requires that the platform's
ROS interface satisfies the conditions listed below. Ensure that all of the requirements
are satisfied for a smooth installation and tuning process.

|      | Requirement |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The platform computer is on the 192.168.131.xxx subnet (ideally in the range 1-4). |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The platform computer has an installation of [ROS 1 Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation). |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | A URDF is supplied to CPR by the customer, in which the `base_link` coordinate frame is defined according to the [REP-105 base-link](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html#base-link) ROS standard.  |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The platform outputs [tf2_msgs/TFMessage](http://docs.ros.org/en/jade/api/tf2_msgs/html/msg/TFMessage.html) messages on the ROS standard `/tf` topic, at a minimum rate of **30 Hz**. |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The platform outputs a latched [tf2_msgs/TFMessage](http://docs.ros.org/en/jade/api/tf2_msgs/html/msg/TFMessage.html) message on the ROS standard `/tf_static` topic. This should include any fixed frames of ROS enabled devices/sensors that are available on your platform. |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The platform computer has a velocity controller that accepts, as input, [geometry_msgs/Twist](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html) messages on the ROS standard `/cmd_vel` topic, at a minimum rate of **10 Hz**. |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The platform computer has a velocity controller that tracks the input velocity and outputs the resulting platform velocity on the `/platform/cmd_vel` topic. |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The platform outputs [nav_msgs/Odometry](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html) messages on the `/platform/odom` topic, at a minimum rate of **10 Hz**. |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The `/platform/odom` topic publishes its data with the header.frame_id = `odom` and the child_frame_id = `base_link`, as per the [REP-105 odom](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html#odom) ROS standard. **IMPORTANT**: The platform should however not broadcast the `odom` --> `base_link` transformation since the OutdoorNav software will do so. |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | If available, the platform odometry output has less than ±5% linear position error. |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | If available, the platform odometry output has less than ±5% orientation error. |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The platform outputs [std_msgs/Bool](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Bool.html) messages on the `/platform/emergency_stop` topic, at a minimum rate of **5 Hz**, indicating whether or not the platform is in a stopped state. |
| <input type="checkbox"/> | Perform the validation tests described in [Interface Control Validation Test](#interface-control-validation) section and [record a rosbag](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Commandline#rosbag_record) of all of your topics. The linear and angular velocities of the three trial runs recorded should be noted here:<br/><br/>Trial #1: Linear x: <input type="text"/>, Angular z: <input type="text"/><br/>Trial #2: Linear x: <input type="text"/>, Angular z: <input type="text"/><br/>Trial #3: Linear x: <input type="text"/>, Angular z: <input type="text"/><br/> |

:::note

Consult the [Platform API](../api/api_endpoints/platform_api.mdx#topics-published-by-platform) for
detailed information on the published/subscribed platform topics.

:::

If the platform is an Ackermann (or double Ackermann) drive vehicle:

|      | Requirement |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <input type="checkbox"/> | A conversion from [geometry_msgs/Twist](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html) messages to Ackermann inputs is provided. |

:::note

Ackermann drive platforms require both steering and throttle inputs to
drive the platform. It is required that our OutdoorNav output `/cmd_vel`
be converted into a message suitable to your platform. An example of an
Ackermann message type can be found
[here](http://wiki.ros.org/teb_local_planner/Tutorials/Planning%20for%20car-like%20robots).
This may satisfy your particular platform, and is only a starting point
on how to do this conversion.

:::

If the platform computer is running a version of ROS 2:

|      | Requirement |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <input type="checkbox"/> | The platform computer has a [ROS 2 to ROS 1 bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge) is installed to enable the exchange of messages between the two ROS versions. |

## Interface Control Validation Test {#interface-control-validation}

The following test is designed to validate the platforms velocity
controller. It will be required that you command the robot to drive in
three circles, of varying radii, by applying the following command to
the platform.

``` bash
rostopic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
x: ___
y: 0.0
z: 0.0
angular:
x: 0.0
y: 0.0
z: ___"
```

The three trials that we request will vary between platforms depending
on the its maximum linear $(v_{max})$ and angular velocities
$(\omega_{max})$, minimum linear $(v_{min})$ and angular velocities
$(\omega_{min})$, as well as limitations due to the minimum allowable
turning radius $(r_{min})$. Of these three trials, we would like to see
data within three linear velocity bands, as seen in the table below,
resulting in three different turning radii. For the purpose of these
tests, the following formula can be used when determining the required
linear and angular velocities to apply: $r = v/\omega$.

| Trial \# | Linear X Bands \[m/s\]                     |  Example Linear X Band \[m/s\] |
| ---------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1        | $v_{min} \cdot [1.0, 1.5]$                 | $[0.5, 0.75]$ |
| 2        | $((v_{max} - v_{min})/2) \cdot [0.9, 1.1]$ | $[2.025, 2.475]$ |
| 3        | $v_{max} \cdot [0.9, 1.0]$                 | $[4.5, 5.0]$ |

As an example, a platform with specs $v \in [0.5, 5.0]$, $r_{min} = 3$
would have linear x velocity bands as listed in the table above. The
trials could then be as outlined in the table below.

| Trial \#  | Linear X \[m/s\]   | Angular Z \[rad/s\] |Turn Radius \[m\] |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1         | 0.75               | 0.25                | 3 |
| 2         | 2.25               | 0.5                 | 4.5 |
| 3         | 4.5                |  0.75               |  6 |

Finally, the test data in the collected ROSbag should include the
following:

1.  `/tf` and `/tf_static`
2.  `/platform/cmd_vel`
3.  `/platform/odom`
4.  `/cmd_vel`
5.  `/platform/emergency_stop` (if available)
6.  raw NavSatFix data from a GPS unit (if possible).

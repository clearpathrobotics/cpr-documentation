As of version 0.13.0, the OutdoorNav software contains the ability for users to set
up Points of Interest (POI) on their map. POIs are intended to be static locations,
landmarks, objects of interest, etc. that a user is able to either navigate to or inspect.

Points of Interest include the following attributes that are used to locate it on the map

- Name
- Latitude/longitude location
- Elevation (above ground level)
- Heading (optional)
- Tags (optional)
- Custom fields

From the user interface, users are able to show all/hide all POIs as well as show and hide POIs
accordidng to their tags. The hotkey, **R**, opens the layers drop down menu and the user can
then click to show/hide the POIs according to their tags. See the
[UI](../support.mdx) page for more information regarding the UI components of POIs.

### Tags

A POI can have 1 or more tags that help classify the POI as part of different groups. By default
the `goto` and `inspect` tags are available for selection on creation of a POI, but custom tags
can be added to each POI as the user sees fit.

## Custom Fields

We also allow the user to define custom fields as part of the POI. These must be defined in a [
JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) formatted string. For example, we want to set a POI at
a gas meter and we want to set the minimum and maximum values that the meter can read. We would
input the following string into the custom fields input box on the UI:

```
{
  "minimum_value": "0.0"
  "maximum_value": "1000.0"
  "units": "cubic ft"
}
```

Another example would be if you are inspecting solar panels at a solar farm you might create POIs
with the following custom fields:

```
{
  "minimum_temperature": "-50.0"
  "maximum_temparature": "100.0"
  "units": "C"
}
```

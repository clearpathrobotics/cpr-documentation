We have enabled the ability to view, through a web browser, the logs of all of the
running docker images on the system. All of the docker images that are related to
OutdoorNav are prefixes with the tag `app-`. To access the logs, either open the user
interface, access the **Menu** &srarr; **Tools** &srarr; **Docker Logs** or navigate to the
following [URL](http://192.168.131.1/_/logs).

The docker logs are enabled using a software called [Dozzle](https://dozzle.dev/).

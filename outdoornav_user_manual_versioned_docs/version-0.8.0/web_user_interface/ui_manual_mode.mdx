The Manual Mode in the Web UI allows the user to operate the UGV
remotely (teleoperate) by using sensors on the UGV to visualize the
environment and by using a joystick to control the motion of the UGV.

Ensure that you have read [Safety](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/safety.mdx) and are
aware of possible hazards when using this product as well as the safety
methods that can be used to stop the moving UGV.

1.  **Speedometer:** An indicator of the UGV's current forward speed.
2.  **Joystick:** The joystick will allow the user to move the UGV
    manually from the UI. Motion can be sent to the UGV in 360Â°
    directions and the speed can be controlled by the distance of the
    joystick from its neutral position.
3.  **Sensitivity Scale:** A UGV-specific scale that controls the
    maximum allowable UGV velocities at each level. The maximum linear
    velocity is 1.0 meters per second and the maximum angular velocity
    is 0.5 radians per second. The scale levels are 100%, 80%, 50% and
    20%, with the default set to 80%.
4.  **Local Docking Buttons:** The local docking/undocking buttons used
    to dock/undock the UGV through the teleop view.  To dock, the UGV 
    must be within the predock distance and facing the dock before the 
    button is selected. 

## Monitor Wireless Strength

While teleoperating the UGV, the user will notice that the delay between
the time a command is sent and the time it is executed (and/or visible
on the UI camera views) will increase as the distance increases. This
effect will be further amplified by any obstacles between the UGV and
the base (eg. walls, vehicles, mounds, etc.). It is important to monitor
this delay an be cautious when driving the UGV with larger delay for
risk of crashing into obstacles.

## Autonomous Missions

1.  **How do I start, pause or stop a mission?**

    See [Mission Execution](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_autonomous_mode#mission-execution) for
    information on how to start, pause or stop a mission.

2.  **When I start a mission the UGV does not move. What could be the
    problem?**

    There could be one of several reasons for why this is happening:

    1.  Check that none of the onboard Motion-Stop actuators are
        activated.
    2.  Check that none of the wireless Motion-Stops are engaged. This
        can be checked via the UI (a red Status Indicator means
        Motion-Stop is engaged) or the onboard UGV lights (will flash
        when Motion-Stop is engaged).
    3.  If OutdoorNav is running on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV
        that is programmed with a Futaba controller, then ensure that
        the controller is turned off. If it is on then it will be
        sending "no motion" commands that will be overriding the
        autonomy commands.
    4.  Check the task settings for each Waypoint in the Mission. 
        A missing task setting for a Move PTZ task will block the 
        execution of the Mission it is in.

3.  **How do I delete a waypoint?**

    Make sure the **Edit Missions** toggle is enabled, then click the
    **Waypoint Mode** button. Now you can click the Waypoint you wish to
    delete. A drop down list will appear. Select **Delete**.

4.  **How do I add a Task to a Waypoint?**

    See [Add Task to Waypoint](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/web_user_interface/ui_autonomous_mode#add-task) for information on how
    to add a Task to a Waypoint.

5.  **Why is the "Save Image" Task failing?**

    Check the Waypoints that have a **Save Image** task in the Waypoint panel. 
    If you see a red warning triangle beside the **Save Image** task it means 
    that the settings for this task were not set. Set them and rerun the
    mission.

6.  **The navigation gets stuck on the "Compute Path" feedback.
    What should I do?**

    Power cycle the UGV by powering off the base platform. Wait 10
    seconds, then turn the base power back on. Allow 1-2 minutes for the
    software to start up and refresh the Web UI page.

7.  **The UGV position and/or heading are behaving erratically while the
    UGV is stationary. What should I do?**

    Power cycle the UGV by powering off the base platform. Wait 10
    seconds, then turn the base power back on, wait 10 seconds, then
    turn the computer power back on (labelled **PWR** on the port/right
    side of mast). Allow 1-2 minutes for the software to startup and
    refresh the Web UI page.

## Autonomous Docking

1.  **When trying to dock, my UGV drives towards the dock but stops 2
    meters away and remains there. "Docking Failed" is displayed in
    the UI feedback bar. How can I fix this?**

    It is likely that one of these 3 things occurred:

    1.  The Base Station was recently resurveyed, or
    2.  The datum was recently changed, or
    3.  The dock location was not set correctly.

    If any of these have occurred recently and you did not reset the
    dock location from the Web UI, you will need to do so by following
    the instructions in [Set Dock Location](/docs_outdoornav_user_manual/getting_started/system_setup#set-dock-location).

## Controllers {#controllers}

### Determine the file location of the parameter {#file_location}

The parameters related to the controller, can be found here:

``` bash
~/cpr_outdoornav_launch/onav_robots/params/<platform_type>/navigation/controls_general.yaml
```

If they are not listed in the above file, it is because they are using the default values and are not being overwritten.

### MPC Controller {#controller}

#### MBF Plugins

Currently we have implemented a Move-Base Flex controller plugin named: **OnavMbfMpcController**

Two instances of this plugin are loaded at runtime by our navigation node (as seen in the table below). The parameters are equivalent for each instance of the plugin but the values of certain of these parameters are different.

| Controller name | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **`mpc_controller`** | The controller used during normal navigation and applies to tracking the paths generated between all the mission waypoints. |
| **`mpc_dock_controller`** | The controller used during docking and applies only to tracking the dock and undock paths. |

#### MPC State Machine

The MPC controller operates as a state machine that contains the following states:

| MPC State | Description | Condition |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **`DEFAULT`**    | Standard tracking behavior.                                         | Will revert to this state if none of the other state conditions are met. |
| **`GOAL`**       | Tracking behavior as the UGV approaches the goal.              | Will enter GOAL mode when the `goal_horizon_threshold` parameter distance to the goal has been reached.|
| **`PRECISE`**    | State when more precision is required in the tracking.              | At the start of the path, we begin in Precise mode to ensure that we have a good start to tracking.|
| **`RESCUE`**     | State to rescue the tracker when the UGV is stuck.             | Will enter RESCUE mode when UGV is appraching a condition that make it stuck.|
| **`HYSTERESIS`** | State when you the UGV requires compensation for tire flexion. | Will enter HYSTERESIS mode when the UGV detects that it will begin oscillating due to tire deformation. |
| **`CORNER`**     | State when there is a curve or a corner ahead.                      | Will enter CORNER mode when the UGV approaches, within a `corner_lookahead` parameter distance, to a corner with at least `corner_detection_threshold` of a curvature.|

#### Default State Parameters {#default_state_params}

The following list defines the default parameters that the MPC controller uses. 
For the most part, they apply to all states of the MPC controller.

| `error_slowdown_multiplier` | The amount by which to increase the MPC horizon based on the crosstrack and/or heading error.

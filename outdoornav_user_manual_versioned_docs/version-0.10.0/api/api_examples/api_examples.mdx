The API Examples section is currently in BETA. That is, we are providing instructions and examples of how to 
generate your own example scripts using our API, however not everyone will be able to run these 
scripts. During the BETA release of this feature, only a select few partners will be eligible to 
run their custom example scripts. Full access/release of this feature will be available in version 0.10.0
(estimated Nov. 2023).

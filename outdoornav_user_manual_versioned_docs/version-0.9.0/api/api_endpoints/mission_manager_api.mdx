The Mission Manager API allows creation, deletion, and modification of OutdoorNav missions.  Mission data is stored
in a databse-like structure on-disk.  The web UI is the primary method of managing missions, but this service
API provides the ability to write your own UI if desired.

#### mission_manager/add_task_to_waypoint

**Service Type:** [clearpath_mission_manager_msgs/srv/AddRemoveById](definitions#storage-addremovebyid)

is added to the end of the Waypoint's `tasks` list.

#### mission_manager/add_waypoint_to_mission

**Service Type:** [clearpath_mission_manager_msgs/srv/AddRemoveById](definitions#storage-addremovebyid)

**Description:** Add an existing Waypoint to an existing Mission.  If the `position` parameter is negative the Waypoint
is added to the end of the Task's `waypoints` list.

#### mission_manager/clone_mission

**Service Type:** [clearpath_mission_manager_msgs/srv/CloneMission](definitions#storage-clonemission)

**Description:** Create a deep-copy of a Mission.  The new Mission will be given the provided name, or reuse the original

In 0.8.0 onward, all missions are required to have unique names.  If the specified name is not unique the cloning will
fail. Cloning a mission multiple times without specifying a unique name will add incrementing numbers to the suffix:
`-copy` for the first, `-copy1` for the second, `-copy2` for the third, and so on.

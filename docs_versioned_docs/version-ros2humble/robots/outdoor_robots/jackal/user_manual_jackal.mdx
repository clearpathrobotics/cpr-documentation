## Introduction

Jackal is a rugged, lightweight, fast and easy-to-use unmanned ground robot for rapid prototyping
and research applications. Jackal includes a computer, as well as basic IMU and GPS. Standard
perception modules are available, including URDF, simulator integration, and demonstration
applications.

<ComponentSafetyWarning />

### Shipment Contents

Your Jackal shipment contains the following:

- Clearpath Robotics Jackal
- 270 Wh lithium battery
- 110 VAC - 220 VAC battery charger
- Sony PS4 Bluetooth controller

If you purchased standard payload modules or custom integration services with Jackal, then additional
equipment will be included per your specific configuration, plus further documentation as required.

### Hardware Overview

#### System Architecture

Jackal is built around a computer running Ubuntu (Intel-based computer or Jetson developer kit), paired
with a 32-bit microcontroller MCU. The MCU handles IO, power supply monitoring and motor control, as well as supplying
data from the integrated IMU and GPS receiver. The communication channel between the MCU and computer is a Full
Speed USB connection, with the MCU operating as a standard serial CDC device.

The communication protocol used is rosserial. An instance of the `rosserial_server` serial node is embedded
in the `jackal_base` node, where it is connected to Jackal's kinematic controller.

An internal magnetometer is available, but not recommended for use due to its location in the vehicle chassis.

#### Exterior Features

The Jackal exterior is shown below and includes:

- 80 mm mounting pattern on the lid
- 190 mm diameter wheels
- Human machine interface panel (HMI)
- Lid latches

#### Payloads

Additional payloads such IMUs, lidars, cameras, GPS, manipulators and many more can be integrated
with Jackal, either as part of your Jackal purchase or installed after receiving your Jackal.
You can find a list of supported packages and related documentation for payloads in this
documention portal, under the [Computers](../../accessories/computers/computers.mdx),
[Sensors](../../accessories/sensors/sensors.mdx), [Manipulators](../../accessories/manipulators/manipulators.mdx),
and [Accessories](../../accessories/add-ons/add-ons.mdx) sections. In addition, refer to [Jackal Integration](integration_jackal.mdx) for
details on how to integrate your own payload or how to integrate a payload kit from Clearpath Robotics.
Each payload kit that ships from Clearpath Robotics comes with a custom mounting bracket and cabling for
easy attachment to Jackal.

#### Interior Features

To access Jackal's interior, actuate the latches under the front end of the lid, on the opposite end from
the HMI. When you lift the lid, you will see Jackal's onboard lithium battery, and its two connectors.
The large Anderson Power Pole connector is to supply power to Jackal and must be connected for
Jackal to operate. The smaller white Molex connector allows the battery to be charged inside Jackal
while Jackal is powered off. It is recommended to connect both. The interior components of Jackal are
labeled below.

## Getting Started

You are ready to go! This section details how to get Jackal into action.
To begin, place Jackal "up on blocks" as described in the [Safety](#safety) section, making sure that the wheels are clear of the ground.

For most Jackal setups, there will be an Onboard Computer which is directly connected to the Jackal and an Offboard Computer
which is used to control Jackal and gather data. These two computers must be set up to communicate with each other.

### Onboard Computer Setup

If you purchased an Onboard Computer from Clearpath Robotics with Jackal, it is already installed, connected, and powered.
If not, or to set up your own Onboard Computer, see the
[Jackal Tutorials](tutorials_jackal.mdx).

Note that the Onboard Computer must be connected to the USB port on the Jackal MCU, which is accessible inside the Jackal.

### Powering Up

If you've just unpacked Jackal from its packaging, you may need to open it up and connect the battery.

Press the power button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-power.png" width="20" /> on Jackal's HMI panel.
The LEDs should show a test pattern, after which you will wait about 30 seconds for the internal computer to finish booting up.
Once it has finished booting, the Comms indicator <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-comms.png" width="20" /> should turn green.
This indicates that ROS is up on the computer and has established communications with the Jackal base.

### Network Configuration

To get Jackal connected to your local Wi-Fi network, you must first access the Onboard Computer using a wired connection to the robot.
Open the chassis, lower the computer tray, and connect to the network port labeled STATIC with a standard
ethernet cable. See the [Jackal Tutorials](tutorials_jackal.mdx) for details
on completing the Wi-Fi setup.

### Connecting and Using the Controller {#controller}

To use your controller, it must be paired with your Jackal and powered on.
If your purchased the Onboard Computer from Clearpath Robotics, your controller is already paired with your Jackal.
If your controller has become unpaired or if you wish to pair a new controller, following the instructions in
the [Jackal Tutorials](tutorials_jackal.mdx).

To teleoperate Jackal, first clear the motion-stop.
Then, power on the controller by pressing the `PS` button on the controller.
Once the blue LED on the top of the controller goes solid, you are paired and ready to drive.
Hold the L1 trigger button (deadman switch) and push the left thumbstick forward to drive the Jackal.
For full speed mode, hold the R1 trigger.
See the figure below for the Sony PS4 controls layout.
If you are not seeing any action, refer to [Support](#jackal-support) to get in touch with support.

### Using ROS

<ComponentUsingRos />

### Battery Charging

When finished with the Jackal, press and release the power button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-power.png" width="20" /> to power it off.

Jackal's lithium battery may be charged internal to the chassis: simply plug in
the charger to the charge port located under the rear fender. Charging will occur
when Jackal is powered down.

Alternatively, if you have multiple batteries, you can easily lift the lid and
remove the battery for external charging. When charging externally, remove the pigtail
which adapts the charger to the platform's weather sealed charge port.

The battery is manufactured for Clearpath Robotics by AllCell Technologies. The
pack includes integrated protections against fault due to overcurrent, overdischarge,
and short circuit. The pack is rugged and designed for the demanding environments into
which Jackal may be deployed.

However, please take note of the following:

- The pack must not be stored or operated above +60 °C or below -19 °C.
- The pack must not be punctured or disassembled.
- The pack should be dropped off or delivered to your local hazardous waste authority for disposal.
- When traveling with Jackal, consult your airline's restrictions regarding lithium
  batteries. If possible, bring the pack in your carry on luggage, where it will
  be subject to normal cabin temperatures and pressures.

Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Jackal's battery or
for information about purchasing additional packs.

## Safety Considerations {#safety}

Clearpath Robotics is committed to high standards of safety.
Jackal contains several features to protect the safety of users and the integrity of the robot.

:::caution

Jackal is a fast moving robotic platform. Please read the following notices carefully.

:::

### General Warnings

Jackal is a rugged and high-performance robot.
For the safety of yourself and others, always conduct initial experiments and software development with
the robot raised off the ground. Place a wooden crate, a set of sawhorses, a sturdy storage tub, or any
other solid flat structure having a height greater than 100 mm under Jackal to keep the wheels clear of the
ground ("up on blocks").

When starting out, favour slower wheel speeds. Jackal's control loops can accurately maintain velocities as low as 0.1 m/s.
Operating at such speeds will give you more time to react if things don't go quite as you expect.

### Motion Stop Buttons {#jackal-stop-buttons}

The Motion Stop button <img src="/img/robot_images/dingo_images/icon-motor.png" width="20" /> is located on the HMI Panel at the back of Jackal.
To engage Stop Mode, press the Motion Stop button once; you should see that the green LED by the Motion Stop button is flashing and that all four corner LEDs are flashing red.
To disengage Stop Mode, press the Motion Stop button again; all LEDs should return to their original values.

When in Stop Mode, the Jackal will not drive.
The commands received while in Stop Mode are not buffered; Jackal will always act on the latest commands received.
This means that if the commands are stopped before the Motion Stop button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode, the Jackal will not move.
If the commands are continued, Jackal will move at the speed commanded once the Motion Stop button is pressed to disengage Stop Mode.

Ensure that the Motion Stop button is accessible at all times.
Avoid mounting payloads that extend over the rear of Jackal and would block access to the Motion Stop button.

### Electrical System

Jackal is powered by batteries capable of delivering high outputs for short durations.
This gives Jackal's motors their great performance; however, it is also enough power to cause severe bodily harm.
Always use caution when operating Jackal to avoid personal injury or property damage.
To ensure safety, please observe the following precautions:

- Do not tamper with the plug attached to the battery.
- Do not tamper with the fuses, except to check and change the fuses.
- Always replace fuses with the same type and rating to ensure continued protection against risk of fires.
- Consult Clearpath Robotics support if you need to service the batteries.
- Charge the battery only with the charger provided by Clearpath Robotics.
- Please dispose of the batteries properly or return them to Clearpath Robotics to do so.

### Lifting and Transport

For the safety of users and to maximize the lifetime of Jackal, please observe the following when manually transporting the robot:

- Ensure that Jackal's Stop Mode is engaged when transporting short distances and powered off when transporting longer distances.
- Do not push the robot at more than 0.5 m/s (1.6 ft/s) or damage to the motor controls may occur.

### Performance Considerations

Included in Jackal are native software checks and limits to protect the robot.
However, it is recommended to monitor the system's status during usage with the `/status` and `/diagnostics` topics.
These topics provide useful information regarding voltages, currents, temperatures and general health of the system.

## Software Bringup
This sensor is included in the Clearpath Robotics robot package that is installed on all of our robots.
This allows you to add or remove the sensor from your robot's software description by modifying the [robot configuration yaml](../../../../ros/config/yaml/sensors/overview.mdx).

<YAML/>

#### Transforms

In order to integrate more easily with existing ROS tools such as RViz and Nav2, the `microstrain_inertial_driver` will publish several transforms.

The default behavior of the device when used in a clearpath robot is to publish the global position of the `odom` frame relative to the first valid fix received by the device,
but it can be configured to publish the global position of a different frame, or no frames at all.
For more information on the transforms published and how to configure them, see the [transforms](https://wiki.ros.org/microstrain_inertial_driver/transforms)
page of the `microstrain_inertial_driver` wiki.

## Software Bringup
This sensor is included in the Clearpath Robotics robot package that is installed on all of our robots.
This allows you to add or remove the sensor from your robot's software description by modifying the [robot configuration yaml](../../../../ros/config/yaml/sensors/overview.mdx).

<YAML/>

#### Antenna Offsets

The GQ7 needs to have it's antenna offsets properly configured in order to get optimal position and orientation estimates. The `microstrain_inertial_driver` makes this easy to do,
and allows multiple ways to accomplish this.

##### From tf tree

The `microstrain_inertial_driver` can look up the location of the antennas from the transform tree as long as it is configured to look for the correct frames.
One can configure antenna offsets to be looked up from the transform tree by including the following parameters

```yaml
gps:
  - model: microstrain_gq7
    ...
    ros_parameters:
      microstrain_inertial_driver:
        gnss1_antenna_offset_source : 2
        gnss1_frame_id              : "right_antenna_link"
        gnss2_antenna_offset_source : 2
        gnss2_frame_id              : "left_antenna_link"
```

A more complete example of configuring the GQ7 to look up the locations of the antennas from the transform tree, and setting up the antennas in the robot.yaml can be found
[here](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_config/tree/main/clearpath_config/sample/j100/j100_microstrain_gq7.yaml)

##### Manually

This method is not recommended for use with clearpath robots as the `robot.yaml` makes it easy to define GNSS antennas in your robot description, but it is the quickest way to get started.
One can configure antenna offsets manually by including the following parameters:

**IMPORTANT**: When manually configuring the antenna offsets, the measurements will be in the MicroStrain vehicle frame. See
[this wiki page](https://wiki.ros.org/microstrain_inertial_driver/use_enu_frame#different_frames) for more information.

```yaml
gps:
  - model: microstrain_gq7
    ...
    ros_parameters:
      microstrain_inertial_driver:
        gnss1_antenna_offset_source : 1
        gnss1_antenna_offset        : [0.0, -0.7, -1.0]  # x, y, z in meters
        gnss2_antenna_offset_source : 1
        gnss2_antenna_offset        : [0.0, -0.7, -1.0]  # x, y, z in meters
```

#### Transforms

In order to integrate more easily with existing ROS tools such as RViz and Nav2, the `microstrain_inertial_driver` will publish several transforms.

The default behavior of the device when used in a clearpath robot is to publish the global position of the `odom` frame relative to the first valid fix received by the device,
but it can be configured to publish the global position of a different frame, or no frames at all.
For more information on the transforms published and how to configure them, see the [transforms](https://wiki.ros.org/microstrain_inertial_driver/transforms)
page of the `microstrain_inertial_driver` wiki.

Controllers appear in Ubuntu in the _/dev/input/_ directory.
Navigate to that directory,and then run `ls` to list the controllers.
You can view the data stream of the controller by running `jstest /dev/input/js0`, changing the final value to the relevent controller.

:::note

You may need to install _jstest_ with `sudo apt-get install jstest-gtk`

:::

Clearpath uses the _/bluetooth_teleop_ ROS node to publish velocity commands from the joystick to _/twist_mux_.
_/twist_mux_ Takes in multiple sources of velocity commands, and prioritizes what actually gets sent to _/cmd_vel_ to drive the robot.

Depending on the robot platform and related controller, you will need to configure your robot's [robot.yaml configuration file](../../../ros/config/yaml.mdx).

Drivers are included in the current Linux Kernels that Clearpath Robotics uses.

The included USB dongle requires a line-of-sight connection with the handheld controller.

This conroller requires a Bluetooth connection to the robot's computer.

This controller includes a PCBA that sends data to the ROS computer with a serial connection.

The controller communicates with the PCBA receiver over a 2.4 GHz radio.

Clearpath Robotics has built this controller into the Warthog and Moose platforms.

It can be integrated on other robots, but requires custom integration as there is not an Open Source ROS driver at this time.

Similar to the Logitech controller listed above, the FORT Robotics controller data appears in _/dev/input/_ and uses a Linux Driver included in the current Ubuntu LTS release.

The controller and receiver communicate over a 900 MHz radio, with the specific band configured based on your country.

:::note

The status of the motion-stop button does appear in the data, as well as the other buttons and joysticks.

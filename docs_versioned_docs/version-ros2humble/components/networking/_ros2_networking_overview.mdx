ROS 2 networking uses an abstracted middleware referred to as the "RMW Implementation". The Clearpath robot packages support
eProsima Fast DDS as the middleware implementation. This middleware has two supported options for ROS 2 node discovery, Simple
Discovery and Discovery Server. Each of these discovery mechanisms has their own use case:

**Simple Discovery**
- Default, does not require manual setup
- Generally operates on the basis that any ROS 2 devices on the network should be discoverable and connect automatically
- Requires multicasting on the network (may be restricted on school or corporate networks)
- Good for simple systems (small number of robots on a dedicated local network)

**Discovery Server**
- Requires manual configuration in the robot.yaml
- Generally operates on the basis that ROS 2 networks should be controlled and can only discover other devices as directed
- Does not require multicasting (more likely to work on school or corporate networks)

:::note

Jackal's MCU is mounted to the rear inside wall of the robot. To access it, open the lid, keeping the computer
tray secured to the underside of the lid.

1. The `M_RST` button, used to reset the MCU.
2. The MCU mode switch. Left is `NORM` or normal mode, right is `ALT` used for flashing the firmware.
3. The mini-USB port used for transmitting data. This should be connected to Jackal's computer for both normal operation and firmware flashing.

:::

Jackal firmware can be flashed from the Jackal's computer.

**1. Download the Jackal Firmware package from the Clearpath package server**

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-jackal-firmware
```

**2. Prepare the Robot**
Place Jackal up on blocks. Firmware loading does not usually result in unintended motion, but it's safest when
off the ground. 
Open the lid of the robot to expose the MCU and connect the mini-USB cable (`3` in the image above).

**3. Place the Jackal MCU into bootloader mode**

Switch the _PWR_MODE_ switch (`2` in the image above) from _NORM_ to _ALT_. If the robot is on, press the _M_RST_ button. Otherwise, turn the
robot on with the power button.

**4. Flash the firmware**

```
jackal_firmware_flash.sh
```

Flashing progress will be indicated by the flash script. Wait for the firmware to finish flashing.

:::caution

Do not turn the robot off or unplug the mini-USB cable while flashing firmware. If an error occurs while
flashing, you can attempt to run `jackal_firmware_flash.sh` again.

:::

**4. Place the Jackal MCU into normal mode**

Once the firmware has been flashed, place the Jackal MCU back into normal mode by switching the PWR_MODE switch from _ALT_ to _NORM_.
The robot will power off. Turn the robot back on by pressing the power button.

Jackal will now be using the new firmware you installed.

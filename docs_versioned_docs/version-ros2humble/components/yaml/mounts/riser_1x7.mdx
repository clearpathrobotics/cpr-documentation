Attach an accessory to the riser by setting the accessory's `parent` parameter to one of the mounts, `riser_0_mount_a1` to `riser_0_mount_g1`.

The mounting location names are based of the existing grid. If the riser is added to the second row instead by setting the `parent` parameter to `top_plate_mount_a2`, then the mounts will be named `riser_0_mount_a2` to `riser_0_mount_g1`.

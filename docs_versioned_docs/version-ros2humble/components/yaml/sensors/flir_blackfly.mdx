#### Package and Setup

The Flir Blackfly cameras use the `spinnaker_camera_driver` ROS 2 package. The driver is open source, maintained by the ROS community, and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver). The `spinnaker_camera_driver` depends on the [Spinnaker SDK](https://www.flir.ca/products/spinnaker-sdk/), which is installed automatically alongside the package.

Before using the camera, the computer needs further setup. The setup can be done automatically using the [linux setup script](https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/blob/humble-devel/spinnaker_camera_driver/scripts/linux_setup_flir):

```bash
ros2 run spinnaker_camera_driver linux_setup_flir
```

Or, manually by following the [instructions on the GitHub README](https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/blob/humble-devel/spinnaker_camera_driver/docs/linux_setup_flir.md).

For specifics on the way Clearpath's configuration system launches the camera, see the Flir Blackfly [launch file](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/blob/main/clearpath_sensors/launch/flir_blackfly.launch.py) and the [default parameter file](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/blob/main/clearpath_sensors/config/flir_blackfly.yaml) in `clearpath_sensors`.

#### Serial Number

The `serial_number` parameter must be set to successfully launch the node. The serial number can be found on the label on the camera. However, if this label is not available and the camera is a USB camera, connect the camera to the computer and use `lsusb` to its three digit `Bus` and `Device` number. Then, find the serial number using the following command, replacing `BUS` and `DEV` with the three digit numbers found in the previous step:

```bash
udevadm info --attribute-walk /dev/bus/usb/BUS/DEV | grep -i serial
```

The resulting output of the command should appear as:

```bash
ATTR{serial}=="013686A9"
```

Then, convert attirbute serial hexadecimal value to decimal representation and set it to the `serial_number` parameter. Convert values from hexadecimal to decimal representation using the following terminal command, where `HEX` needs to be swapped with the hexadecimal value:

```bash
echo $((16#HEX))
```

For the example above, the hexadecimal serial number `013686A9` would be converted to `20350633`. Use the decimal representation to set the parameter: `serial_number: 20350633`.

#### Resolution

The `image_height` and `image_width` parameters define the area of the raw image to crop. It does not downsample the image. Use the `offset_x` and `offset_y` parameters to change the origin of the cropped area. These parameters would be best used to define an area of interest.

To reduce the size of the image using downsamlping, use the `binning_x` and `binning_y` parameters. These parameters define the number of pixels that will be binned together in each axis. If both `binning_x` and `binning_y` are set to `2`, then the resolution of the image will be halved.

Reducing the resolution of the image improves the perfomance of the camera driver and network transit of image packets.

The default networking configuration for a robot's computer is to bridge all ethernet interfaces and assign the computer
the IP address `192.168.131.1`. See [Network IP Addresses](./network_ip_addresses.mdx) for a detailed list of IP ranges.

To configure the default bridge:
1. Run `sudo clearpath-computer-setup` 
2. Navigate to **Netplan Setup** -> **Pre-set Configurations**.
3. Select **Standard Clearpath Bridge** and generate the configuration by following the instructions.
4. Return to the **Netplan Setup** menu and select **Apply Configuration Changes**.

This will create a `/etc/netplan/50-clearpath-standard.yaml` file and apply the changes to `netplan`.

Once the network settings have been applied, call `ip a` to check that the network bridge has been created, and
that the computer has been assigned the `192.168.131.1` IP address.

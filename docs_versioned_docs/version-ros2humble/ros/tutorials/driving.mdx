:::caution

Make sure you have successfully [set up](../installation/robot.mdx) the robot before attempting to drive it.

:::

There are several ways to drive a Clearpath robot using ROS 2.

### Joystick Teleoperation

Make sure your controller is paired to the robot computer. Visit the [controller pairing](../installation/controller.mdx) guide for details.

With the [robot services](../installation/robot.mdx#robot-services) running, turn on your controller. Press and hold
either **L1** or **R1**, and use the left joystick to publish a linear velocity and yaw command. The **L1** button
will drive the robot at slow speeds, while **R1** will drive the robot at fast speeds.

### Keyboard Teleoperation

Install the `teleop_twist_keyboard` ROS 2 package on the robot computer or on an offboard computer:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard
```

Once installed, run the node:

```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

If your robot uses a namespace, the namespace should be applied to `teleop_twist_keyboard`:

```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r __ns:=/j100_0001
```

### Command Velocity

You can manually publish to the `cmd_vel` topic through the command line by calling:

```
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
"linear:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0"
```

Set the `linear.x` value to drive the robot forwards or backwards, and the `angular.z` value to rotate left or right.

Simulating an arm in Gazebo Ignition is a safe alternative to test path planning and execution MoveIt! plugins, MoveIt! commander scripts, or simple commands completely independent of the MoveIt! libraries. We facilitate the process of setting up simulations, by providing a customizable, simulated mobile robot platform with sensors and manipulators utilizing the Clearpath Configuration System.

In this tutorial, we will cover using the MoveIt! Planning and Execution RViz plug-in to move arms to a predefined pose. We will use the A200 platform with a Kinova Gen3 Lite in the [Clearpath simulator](../simulator/overview.mdx).

The `robot.yaml` configuration we will use is included below.

<details><summary>A200 YAML</summary>
<p>

```yaml
serial_number: a200-0000
version: 0
system:
  hosts:
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0000
      ip: 192.168.131.1
  ros2:
    namespace: a200_0000
platform:
  attachments:
    - name: front_bumper
      type: a200.bumper
      parent: front_bumper_mount
    - name: rear_bumper
      type: a200.bumper
      parent: rear_bumper_mount
    - name: top_plate
      type: a200.top_plate
manipulators:
  arms:
    - model: kinova_gen3_lite
      parent: top_plate_default_mount
      xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
      rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
      ip: 192.168.131.40
      port: 10000
      gripper:
        model: kinova_2f_lite
```

## Launching the Simulation
Move the `robot.yaml` file to your setup directory (`$HOME/clearpath` by default).

Launch the simulation
```
ros2 launch clearpath_gz simulation.launch.py setup_path:=$HOME/clearpath
```

Click on the orange play button in the bottom left corner to start the simulation.

At this point, you will have the platform and manipulator controllers loaded and activated; you can send joint commands to the manipulators and velocity commands to the platform. However, depending on the joint states sent, the manipulators may collide with itself or the platform. Therefore, it is recommended to use MoveIt! to plan and execute collision free paths.

## Launching MoveIt!
Launch MoveIt! by passing the same robot setup directory and setting the simulation flag.
```
ros2 launch clearpath_manipulators moveit.launch.py setup_path:=$HOME/clearpath use_sim_time:=true
```

Now, you have the `move_group` node that can be utilized to send a joint or pose goal to a specific manipulation group. However, for this tutorial, we will cover how to visualize the arm in RViz and send goals through the plug-in.

## Launching RViz
Launch RViz by passing the robot's namespace and enabling the simulation flag.
```
ros2 launch clearpath_viz view_moveit.launch.py namespace:=a200_0000 use_sim_time:=True
```
:::note
The namespace is defined in the `robot.yaml` using the `system.ros2.namespace` parameter.

### Standard Clearpath Bridge

### Custom Networking

The `clearpath-computer-setup` tool can also be used to set up custom network interfaces. 

1. Navigate to the **Netplan Setup** menu and use the bridge, ethernet, or Wi-Fi setup menus to add configurations.
2. Once you are done configuring, return to the **Netplan Setup** menu and select **Write Configuration YAML**. You will be prompted for a file name. The file should be
placed under `/etc/netplan/` to take effect, and the naming convention is a two digit number followed by a unique name.
For example, `/etc/netplan/50-home-wifi.yaml`.

:::note

Netplan will read files under `/etc/netplan/` in alphanumeric order. Files beginning in `01` will be read first, and `99` will be read last.
If two files define the same configuration, the configuration read last will be used. Otherwise, netplan will
amalgamate all files under `/etc/netplan/` to create the netplan configuration.

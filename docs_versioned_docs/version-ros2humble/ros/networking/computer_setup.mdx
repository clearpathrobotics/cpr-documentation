The `clearpath_computer_setup` package offers a terminal menu tool for configuring a robot computer. The main feature of this tool is the ability to generate
`netplan` configurations. The `clearpath_computer_setup` package is available on the [Clearpath package server](../installation/robot.mdx#clearpath-package-server).

It should be installed on the robot's computer:

```
sudo apt install python3-clearpath-computer-setup
```

To run the tool, call:

```
sudo clearpath-computer-setup
```

### Standard Clearpath Bridge

The default networking configuration for a robot's computer is to bridge all ethernet interfaces and assign the computer the IP address `192.168.131.1`. See [Network IP Addresses](./network_ip_addresses.mdx) for a detailed list of IP ranges.

To configure the default bridge, run `clearpath-computer-setup` and navigate to **Netplan Setup** -> **Pre-set Configurations**. Select **Standard Clearpath Bridge** and generate the configuration by following the instructions. Then, return to the **Netplan Setup** menu and select **Apply Configuration Changes**.
This will create a `/etc/netplan/50-clearpath-standard.yaml` file and apply the changes to `netplan`.

Once the network settings have been applied, call `ip a` to check that the network bridge has been created, and that the computer has been assigned the `192.168.131.1` IP address.

### Custom Networking

The `clearpath-computer-setup` tool can also be used to set up custom network interfaces. Navigate to the **Netplan Setup** menu and use the bridge, ethernet, or Wi-Fi setup menus to add configurations. Once you are done configuring, return to the **Netplan Setup** menu and select **Write Configuration YAML**. You will be prompted for a file name. The file should be placed under `/etc/netplan/` to take effect, and the naming convention is a two digit number followed by a unique name. For example, `/etc/netplan/50-home-wifi.yaml`.

:::note

Netplan will read files under `/etc/netplan/` in alphanumeric order. Files beginning in `01` will be read first, and `99` will be read last.
If two files define the same configuration, the configuration read last will be used. Otherwise, netplan will amalgamate all files under `/etc/netplan/` to create the netplan configuration.

## How Discovery Works

### Simple Discovery

Participants (nodes) send periodic multicast announcement messages over the network with their unicast addresses, and
then all participants share discovery information (such as topics, action servers, etc.) with all other participants.
This means that all participants get information about all other participants irrelevant of whether or not they need
that information.

The following diagram depicts three Husky A200's set up with simple discovery and illustrates how different
combinations of settings work. The robot type is not important, and the same diagram can be made for any
combination of Clearpath robots.

[eProsima Fast DDS documentation](https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/ros2/ros2.html).

Additional details on how to select simple disocvery in the `robot.yaml` config file are available in the
[Middleware section of Robot Configuration](../config/yaml/system.mdx#middleware).

### Discovery Server

A discovery server is a process running on a computer that serves to record and report ROS discovery information.
A server can be though of as a look up table for ROS discovery information. When a participant (node) starts, it
checks in with the servers to share its discovery information and request what information it is looking for.
In this way, particpants only get discovery information and establish communication as necessary. A participant
does not know all of the information that is available, only where to find the fellow participants that it needs.

There can be multiple servers in a given system. These can be used for redundancy or to segregate information.

The following diagram depicts three Husky A200's set up with discovery server and illustrates how different
combinations of settings work. The `ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER` environment variable indicates which discovery servers
a given robot should communicate with. The robot type is not important and the same diagram can be made for any
combination of Clearpath robots.

## Choosing a Configuration

The first decision is choosing between simple discovery and discovery server. If simple discovery works for you then
there is no need to change from the default operation. Simple discovery generally allows for any ROS 2 and Fast DDS
enabled device running the default settings to connect to the system with no additional configuration.

:::tip

If you want to run multiple independent simple discovery systems on the same network, you can segregate them by
using different ROS Domain IDs.

:::

You may want or need to switch to discovery server for any of the following reasons:
- If your network does not support multicasting (often true on school or corporate networks)
- If you have a large system (several robots or an excess number of nodes/topics)
- If you want to control which devices have access to which information
- If you have a weak network (for example in cases of long range wireless connection)

:::note

Certain networks (such as school or corporate networks) may have additional restrictions that prevent even
ROS 2 with discovery server from operating. In these situations consider meeting with the IT group or the network
administrator to determine if ROS 2 is allowed to run on that network or if you can run the system on a separate
dedicated network.

## Discovery Server Configurations

There are multiple different ways to configure discovery server depending on which ROS 2 devices need to connect.
This section will go over some basic configurations and is generalized for use as an introduction. It does not
describe all possible configurations. The `ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER` environment variable, shown in the various diagrams,
indicates which discovery servers a given robot is connected to. Additionally, communication will be referred to
in terms of seeing ROS 2 topics although this is representative of all nodes, topics, action servers, etc. 

:::note

For all configurations, it is very important for all discovery servers in the system to be included in the `servers`
list in the `robot.yaml` config. This is because each discovery server must have a unique ID number which
is used both to launch the server and to connect to the server. This ID is automatically assigned by the Clearpath
packages.

:::

### 1. Fully Connected {#fully-connected}

This configuration is the simplest to set up using the `robot.yaml` config. It allows all robots to operate
independently but also allows any ROS 2 device in the system to see all of the topics from all of the
ROS 2 devices. This is done by having a local discovery server on each robot and pointing each ROS 2 device
in the system at all of the discovery servers in the system.

      src={require("./img/ros2-fastdds-fully-connected-diagram.png").default}
      width="500"
    />
  </figure>
</center>

This configuration is achieved by listing all of the computers' hostnames in the
[`servers` section](../config/yaml/system.mdx#servers) on all of the robots. Including the remote PC allows
the remote PC to also have a discovery server running and thus operate independently from the robots as
well as communicating with all of the robots. However, the discovery server must also be set up separately on the
remote PC (only required to allow the remote PC to run ROS 2 nodes independently from the robots).

The middleware section for the system in the diagram would look like the following on all devices:

```yaml
middleware:
  implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
  discovery: server
  servers:
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0000
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0001
    - hostname: remote-pc
```

Additional details on the available fields for the `robot.yaml` config file are available in the
[Middleware section of Robot Configuration](../config/yaml/system.mdx#middleware).

### 2. Command Center {#command-center}

In this configuration you have many robots that each operate independently and a remote PC that
checks in and communicates with each of the robots. Each of the robots will have and refer to their own local
discovery server. This allows the onboard ROS 2 nodes to communicate without any external network connection.
The remote PC will be pointed at the discovery servers on each and every robot. This will allow the
remote PC to see all of the topics on all of the robots at the same time. In turn, each of the robots will be
able to see all of the topics launched on the remote PC. Including a discovery server on the remote PC as well
allows it to run ROS 2 nodes independently from the robots.

The key difference between this configuration and the fully connected configuration is that the robots cannot
communicate with each other. This may be beneficial if the network is weak, or if there is an excess number of
robots.

      src={require("./img/ros2-fastdds-command-center-diagram.png").default}
      width="600"
    />
  </figure>
</center>

This configuration is achieved by listing all of the computers' hostnames in the
[`servers` section](../config/yaml/system.mdx#servers) on all of the robots but setting `enabled` to `False` for
every server entry except for that specific robot. This tells the robot to only use its own discovery server.
The Remote PC should have all of the servers enabled, telling it to connect to all discovery servers in the system.
This servers list must include the remote PC if a discovery server is being run on the remote PC. However, the discovery
server must also be set up separately on the remote PC.

The middleware section of the config for the system in the diagram would look like the following for `cpr-a200-0000`:

```yaml
middleware:
  implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
  discovery: server
  servers:
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0000
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0001
      enabled: False
    - hostname: remote-pc
      enabled: False
```

It would look like the following for `cpr-a200-0001`:

```yaml
middleware:
  implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
  discovery: server
  servers:
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0000
      enabled: False
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0001
    - hostname: remote-pc
      enabled: False
```

And the following for the Remote PC:

```yaml
middleware:
  implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
  discovery: server
  servers:
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0000
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0001
    - hostname: remote-pc
```

Additional details on the available fields for the `robot.yaml` config file are available in the
[Middleware section of Robot Configuration](../config/yaml/system.mdx#middleware).

## Remote PC Setup {#remote-pc}

Use the `robot.yaml` from one of the robots in order to set up the remote PC. The `servers` list must include all of
the discovery servers and all of the ones that the remote PC should be connecting with must not be disabled.

1. Regenerate the `setup.bash` every time the `servers` list changes in any way (as per [remote PC install instructions](../installation/remote_pc.mdx#setup-folder))

2. If a discovery server is intended to be run on the remote PC then generate and run the discovery-server-start launch file.

To generate the launch script:

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run clearpath_generator_common generate_discovery_server -s ~/clearpath
```

To launch the server

```
bash -e ~/clearpath/discovery-server-start 
```

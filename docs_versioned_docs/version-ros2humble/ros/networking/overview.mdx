### SSH and SFTP

Clearpath robots ship with an SSH server operating on port 22 for remote login. This server also supports sftp for
file-transfer to/from the robot if needed. By default you can log in using the default username and password for the
robot.

### Wired LAN IP Addresses {#ip-addresses}

All Clearpath robots use the `192.168.131.0/24` subnet for any permanently-installed network hardware. This includes,
but may not be limited to

- the robot's primary computer,
- the robot's MCU,
- a secondary computer (if present),
- any cameras, lidar, or other sensors that communicate over Ethernet, and
- any long-range wireless radios.

The `192.168.131.0/24` subnet is statically configured; all devices are configured to use a static IP address, and
there is normally not a DHCP server operating on this subnet.

For a list of standard payload IP addresses, please see [network IP addresses](network_ip_addresses.mdx).

:::tip

For the best chance of success, use a high speed, high bandwidth network and monitor the network usage.

### Clock Synchronization

If your robot contains multiple computers, their clocks must remain synchronized to allow proper communication between
ROS nodes running on each one. Clearpath configures the computers to use `chrony` to synchronize the clocks, with the
primary computer being the authoritative source for the others.

For details on configuring `chrony`, please see [configuring NTP](ntp.mdx).

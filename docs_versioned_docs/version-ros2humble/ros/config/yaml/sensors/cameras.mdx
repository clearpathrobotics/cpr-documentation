Cameras are sensors that publish:
 - Messages of type `sensor_msgs/Image` to the `/sensors/camera_#/color/image` topic.
 - Messages of type `sensor_msgs/CameraInfo` to the `/sensors/camera_#/color/CameraInfo` topic.

This broad definition allows us to label a variety of different cameras under a single banner. Stereo cameras, for example, could publish multiple images, disparity maps, and even pointclouds. Other cameras have in built inertial measurement units that publish `sensor_msgs/Imu`. Ultimately, all imaging devices fall into this category.


## Compressed and Theora Topics
Using the `image_transport` package and the [image_transport_plugins](https://github.com/ros-perception/image_transport_plugins), it is possible to send compressed and stream images using ROS 2 messages.

For example, the color image topic will have multiple versions:
```bash
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/color/image
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/color/compressed
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/color/theora
```

:::note

The same publisher handles all three of these message types. Limit the number of subscribers to minimize the load on the camera driver node.

:::

Compressed and theora types are not standard ROS 2 types, and therefore, it is required to decompress the images into standard `sensor_msgs/Image` messages before attempting to view them using standard tools such as RViz.

The `clearpath_sensors` package has launch files to convert from and to these compressed transport types. Therefore, make sure to have the package installed on the computer that will be doing the decompressing:
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-clearpath-sensors
```

### Compressed
Compressed image types are not serialized. These are images compressed using the JPEG format at 80% quality.

Use the launch file `image_raw_to_compressed.launch.py` to compress `sensor_msgs/Image` messages into compressed messages.
therefore,
Assume we have the following image topic we would like to compress:
```bash
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/image
```

Then, we can compress this image by launching the following:
```bash
ros2 launch clearpath_sensors image_raw_to_compressed.launch.py in_raw:=/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/image out_compressed:=/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/compressed
```

Now, we will have the following topics:
```bash
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/image
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/compressed
```

To reverse this process, use the `image_compressed_to_raw.launch.py` to decompress back to `sensor_msgs/Image`:
```bash
ros2 launch clearpath_sensors image_compressed_to_raw.launch.py in_compressed:=/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/compressed out_raw:=/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/decompressed/image
```

Now, we will have the following topics:
```bash
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/image
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/compressed
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/decompressed/image
```

### Theora
Theora topics encode images into a video stream. By default, these streams have an 800 kb/s rate.

Theora messages are not serialized, however, the first message after launching the encoder transmits the header packet. This header packet includes all of the encoding information required to decode the subsequent video packets. Therefore, if that first message is dropped or missed, then decoding the video packets back to images is not possible.

Therefore, it is important to have the decoder node running before launching the encoder node, such that the former will not miss the header packet.

:::warning
Missing the header packet and being unable to decode the video packets is a known, long-standing issue with the `theora` image transport plugin. See this [issue](https://github.com/ros-perception/image_transport_plugins/issues/4) for more information.
:::

Assuming we have the following topic that we would like to stream:
```bash
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/image
```

First, launch the decoder:
```bash
ros2 launch clearpath_sensors image_theora_to_raw.launch.py in_theora:=/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/theora out_raw:=/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/decoded/image
```

Then, launch the encoder:
```bash
ros2 launch clearpath_sensors image_raw_to_theora.launch.py in_raw:=/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/image out_raw:=/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/theora
```

As long as the first header package is communicated without drops, the decoder will be able to decode and publish the raw image data:
```bash
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/image
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/raw/theora
/a200_0000/sensors/camera_0/decoded/image
```

## Republishers
All cameras publish to the `color/image` topic of type `sensor_msgs/Image`. However, we understand that sometimes this image may require downsampling, rectification, or cropping. To facilitate post processing images, we have included a method to easily add image processing nodes, leveraging composable nodes to maximize efficiency.

:::note

For more information on the image processing nodes see the [ROS wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/image_proc).

:::

Adding a republisher is simple.
- Add a `republishers` tag under the `camera` entry.
- Specify the `type` of republisher: `rectify` or `resize`.
- Specify the `input` topic namespace. By default, it is `color` because the standard image topic will be `color/image`.
- Specify the `output` topic namespace. By default, it is the type of the republisher: `{type}/image`.

Configuring a republisher can be done by setting its node parameters using the `ros_parameters` section.
- Under `ros_parameters` add an entry for the node `image_TYPE_INPUT`. Note, the node name depends on the `type` of republisher and the `input` name.
- Add any parameter key, value pair to configure the node. Otherwise, it can be left empty to use defaults.

### Rectify
The `rectify` node takes the `camera_info` topic as a source of calibration parameters and applies an interpolation to rectify the raw images.

To add a the rectify republisher add the following entries to the `camera` entry and its corresponding `ros_parameters` section.
```yaml
cameras:
  - model: CAMERA_MODEL
    republishers:
      - type: rectify
        input: color
        output: rectify
    ros_parameters:
      CAMERA_NODE:
        CAMERA_PARAMETER_KEY: CAMERA_PARAMETER_VALUE
      image_rectify_color:
        interpolation: 0
```

The `interpolation` parameter must be one of the following:
- **0**: Nearest-neighbour.
- **1**: Linear.
- **2**: Cubic.
- **3**: Area. Resampling using pixel area relation.
- **4**: Lanczos4. Lanczos interpolation over 8x8 neighbourhood.

:::note

All UPPERCASE entries must be replaced based on the specific camera being used.

:::

### Resize
The `resize` node uses the input image and resizes it.

To add a resize republisher add teh following entreis to the `camera` entry and its corresponding `ros_parameters` section.
```yaml
cameras:
  - model: CAMERA_MODEL
    republishers:
      - type: resize
        input: color
        output: resize
    ros_parameters:
      CAMERA_NODE:
        CAMERA_PARAMETER_KEY: CAMERA_PARAMETER_VALUE
      image_resize_color:
        interpolation: 1
        use_scale: True
        scale_height: 1.0
        scale_width: 1.0
        height: -1
        width: -1
```
If `use_scale` is set to `true`, then the `scale_height` and `scale_width` parameters will be used to resize the image. To reduce the size of the image by half, set `scale_height: 0.5` and `scale_width: 0.5`.

If `use_scale` is set to `false`, then the `height` and `width` parameters will be used to resize the image. In this case, the exact pixel values of the desired image size can be passed.

:::note

The `scale_height` and `scale_width` parameters must be floating point values.

The `height` and `width` parameters must be integer values.

:::

The `interpolation` parameters must be one of the following:
- **0**: Nearest-neighbour.
- **1**: Linear.
- **2**: Cubic.
- **3**: Area. Resampling using pixel area relation.
- **4**: Lanczos4. Lanczos interpolation over 8x8 neighbourhood.

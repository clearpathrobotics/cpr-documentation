## Bumper

The A200 can have bumpers of a variable length. By setting the `extension` parameter, the bumper can be extended if required.

By default, we have two bumpers, on the front and rear of the robot.

## Top Plate

The A200 has three types of top plates that modify the mounting surface of the robot.

#### Default

The **default** top plate is mounted atop a user rail that can be used to mount certain payload inside the chassis and right below the top plate.

#### Large

The **large** top plate does not have a user rail and is primarily used to mount larger payloads such as manipulators on the robot.

#### PACS

The **pacs** top plate does not have a user rail. It has an opening to access the user bay within the chassis. It comes with the grid of mounting holes of the PACSâ„¢ **80mm x 80mm** grid.

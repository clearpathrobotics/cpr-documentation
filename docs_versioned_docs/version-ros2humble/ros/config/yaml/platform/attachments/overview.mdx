Each robot platform has its own unique set of attachments. To facilitate customization, any attachment from any robot platform can be added on any other robot platform.

There is a default `parent` link at which these attachments are added. However, the `parent` link can be changed to wherever attachment needs to be placed.

Additionally, all attachments can be moved around using the `xyz` parameter to translate and the `rpy` parameter to rotate.

Each attachment requires two parameters. The `name` parameter that will define the name of the links and joints added to URDF, and the `type` parameter which defines which type of attachment is to be added.

Some attachment types will have the same `type` parameter across different platforms. In that case, if you'd like to use the attachment that belongs to a specific platform, you will need to prefix the `type` parameter with the platform that it belongs to. For example, `top_plate` would become `a200.top_plate`. If no prefix is set, then the platform defined in the `serial_number` will be used.

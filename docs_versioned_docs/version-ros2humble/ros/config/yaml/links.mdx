Links are any URDF primitive.
:::tip keep the frames in mind:
Just as is the case in URDF, links have their frame at the center of the primitive. In other words, you will need to slide up all links by half their height to have it "sit" on its parent link.
:::

## Frame

Just a link without any geometry.

<LinkFrame />

## Box

A box of defined size.

<Box />

## Cylinder

A cylinder of defined height and radius.

<Cylinder />

## Sphere

A sphere of defined radius.

<Sphere />

## Mesh

Include your custom mesh without creating a URDF of your own. You can either provide an absolute link
to the mesh file or if it is included in a ROS 2 package, then you can provide both the package name
and relative link to the install location within the package.

If you prefer to add a URDF instead, then you can link it directly through the [`platform.extras`](platform.mdx#extras) entry.

## Sample

<details><summary>Sample A200 Links Section</summary>
<p>

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src={require("../img/husky_platform_2.png").default}
      width="500"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky A200 with Open User Bay</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

In this sample, we will use links to add thin **box** to cover up the user bay.

We add an entry under the **box** list:

```yaml
box:
  - name: user_bay_cover
    parent: top_plate_link # add it to the top_plate_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.00735] # move it up 6.35mm (thickness of top plate) and move it up 1mm (half height of the box)
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    size: [0.4, 0.4, 0.002] # length 400mm, width 400mm and 2mm thick.
```

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src={require("../img/husky_accessories_0.png").default}
      width="500"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky A200 with Covered User Bay</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

We leave the rest of the lists all empty, for the resulting links section:

```yaml
links:
  box:
    - name: user_bay_cover
      parent: top_plate_link
      xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.00735]
      rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
      size: [0.4, 0.4, 0.002]
  cylinder: []
  frame: []
  mesh: []
  sphere: []

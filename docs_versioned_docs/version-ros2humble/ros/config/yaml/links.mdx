Links are any URDF primitive:

1. **frame** in the URDF without any geometry, i.e. just a frame.

```yaml
frame:
  - name: link_name
    parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

2. **box** of given length, width, and height.

```yaml
box:
  - name: box_name
    parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    size: [0.01, 0.01, 0.01]
```

3. **cylinder** of given radius and height.

```yaml
cylinder:
  - name: cylinder_name
    parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    radius: 0.01
    length: 0.01
```

4. **sphere** of given radius.

```yaml
sphere:
  - name: sphere_name
    parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    radius: 0.01
```

5. **mesh** from a given absolute path to STL or OBJ file.

```yaml
mesh:
  - name: mesh_name
    parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    visual: /absolute/path/to/mesh.stl
```

If a user needs to add a mesh or primitive to represent a payload on their robot, they can either create a URDF and use the platform extras, or they can add an link directly through the `robot.yaml`.

Just as is the case in URDF, links are added at the center of the primitive. In other words, you will need to slide up all links by half their height to have it "sit" on its parent link.

# Sample

<details><summary>Sample A200 Links Section</summary>
<p>

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src={require("../img/husky_platform_2.png").default}
      width="500"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky A200 with Open User Bay</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

In this sample, we will use links to add thin **box** to cover up the user bay.

We add an entry under the **box** list:

```yaml
box:
  - name: user_bay_cover
    parent: top_plate_link # add it to the top_plate_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.00735] # move it up 6.35mm (thickness of top plate) and move it up 1mm (half height of the box)
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    size: [0.4, 0.4, 0.002] # length 400mm, width 400mm and 2mm thick.
```

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src={require("../img/husky_accessories_0.png").default}
      width="500"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky A200 with Covered User Bay</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

We leave the rest of the lists all empty, for the resulting links section:

```yaml
links:
  box:
    - name: user_bay_cover
      parent: top_plate_link
      xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.00735]
      rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
      size: [0.4, 0.4, 0.002]
  cylinder: []
  frame: []
  mesh: []
  sphere: []
```

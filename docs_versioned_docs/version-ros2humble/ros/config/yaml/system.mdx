Proper networking setup is crucial in setting up the ROS 2 middleware and to ensure other onboard computers communicate reliably.

## Username

The username indicates the username that will be used to run all ROS nodes. If this username needs to be changed then the robot
services must be reinstalled as directed in the [software installation instructions](../../installation/robot.mdx#robot-services).

## Hosts

The **hosts** section serves as a way to match hostnames to IP addresses. By default, Clearpath robots use the serial number as
the hostname and have a default IP of `192.168.131.1`. This section must define ip addresses for all hostnames that appear in
the remainder of the `robot.yaml` file. 

For example:

```yaml
  hosts:
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0000 # The robot computer
      ip: 192.168.131.1
    - hostname: offboard-computer
      ip: 192.168.131.5
```

## ROS 2 Environment

The **ros2** section is necessary to set up the ROS 2 networking.

| Key | Value / Datatype | Description |
|:---:| :--------------: | ----------- |
| **namespace**  | string    | Specified will be appended as a prefix to all sensor topics to prevent topics from being overloaded when multiple robots are on the same network and domain ID. |
| **domain_id**  | integer   | Specifies the ROS 2 domain ID to use. |
| **middleware** | [See Below](#middleware) | Specifies the ROS 2 middleware settings. |
| **workspaces** | list      | Indicates a list of custom ROS 2 workspaces that need to be sourced by specifying the path to the setup.bash or set to `[]` to leave it blank |

For example:

```yaml
ros2:
  username: administrator
  namespace: a200_0000
  domain_id: 0
  middleware: # This section is described further below
    implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
  workspaces:
    - /home/administrator/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash # Path to the custom workspace
```

### Middleware

The **middleware** section defines the which RMW Implementation to use and any related settings. To choose
which implementation and discovery method is right for your project see [networking](../../networking/ros2-networking.mdx).

| Key | Value / Datatype | Description |
|:---:| :--------------: | ----------- |
| **implementation** | `rmw_fastrtps_cpp`   | Declares the RMW Implementation to use. Currently only supports `rmw_fastrtps_cpp`. |
| **discovery**      | `simple` or `server` | Select `simple` for simple discovery and `server` for discovery server. (Defaults to `simple`) |
| **profile**        | string               | Advanced feature, allows an optional custom XML profile to be provided - RMW Implementation / vendor specific. |
| **servers**        | list                 | Provides a list of all discovery servers in the system and whether or not the robot should connect to them. |

For example:

```yaml
middleware:
  implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
  discovery: simple
  profile: path/to/profile.xml
  servers: # This section is described further below
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0000
```

#### Servers

This section is only used with eProsima Fast DDS Discovery Server (`implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp` and `discovery: server`).

:::note

This section must define *every single discovery server* in the system. This must include not only every discovery server
that this robot is connecting to but also every discovery server that the offboard computer will connect to in the system.

:::

Each server can be defined with a number of different parameters:

| Key | Value / Datatype | Description |
|:---:| :--------------: | ----------- |
| **hostname** | string            | The hostname of the computer that is hosting the server (must be in the [hosts](#Hosts) list). |
| **port**     | integer           | The port at which to connect to the server (default is `11811`). |
| **enabled**  | `True` or `False` | This indicates whether or not the robot should connect to this server and, if the hostname matches the computer's own hostname, whether or not to launch the server (default is `True`). |

For example:
```yaml
servers:
  - hostname: cpr-a200-0000
    port: 11811
    enabled: True
```

## Sample

<details><summary>Sample A200 System Section</summary>
<p>

In our sample, we have a **Husky A200** platform whose primary computer has the hostname: `cpr-a200-0000` and IP: `192.168.131.1`.

By default, all Clearpath robots use the username `administrator` and the robot's namespace matches the `serial_number`.

```yaml
system:
  username: administrator
  hosts:
    - hostname: cpr-a200-0000
      ip: 192.168.131.1
  ros2:
    namespace: a200_0000
    domain_id: 0
    middleware:
      implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
      discovery: simple
    workspaces: []
```

At this point, with just the **serial_number** and **system** defined, our robot is just the standard **Husky A200** platform, and looks like this:

Proper networking setup is crucial in setting up the ROS 2 middleware and ensure other onboard computers communicate reliably.

### Hosts

The **hosts** section serves as a way to match IP addresses to hostnames. By default, Clearpath robots use the serial number as the hostname and have a default IP of `192.168.131.1`.

- The **self** entry refers to what hostname is this configuration file on.
- The **platform** entry refers to the hostname and IP of the robot platform's main computer.
- The **onboard** entry is used to define the hostname and IP of other computers on the robot.
- The **remote** entry is used to define the hostname and IP of computers in the system that are not on the robot, such as a user's PC.

### ROS 2 Environment

The **ros2** sections is necessary to setup the ROS 2 middleware.

- **username** must match the username of the user that is to run all ROS nodes.
- **namespace** specified will be appended as a prefix to all sensor topics to prevent topic cloberring when multiple robots are on the same network and domain ID.
- **domain_id** specifies the ROS 2 domain ID to use.
- **rmw_implementation** specifies the ROS 2 middleware to use. **Currently, it only supports `rmw_fastrtps_cpp`.**
- **workspaces** indicates a list of workspaces that need to be sourced by specifying the path to the setup.py

# Sample

<details><summary>Sample A200 System Section</summary>
<p>

In our sample, we have a **Husky A200** platform whose primary computer has hostname: `cpr-a200-0000` and IP: `192.168.131.1`.

And, note that this configuration YAML is meant to be on that primary computer, hence `self: cpr-a200-0000`.

By default, all Clearpath robots use username `administrator` and the robot's namespace matches the `serial_number`.

```yaml
system:
  hosts:
    self: cpr-a200-0000
    platform:
      cpr-a200-0000: 192.168.131.1
    onboard: {}
    remote: {}
  ros2:
    username: administrator
    namespace: a200_0000
    domain_id: 0
    rmw_implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
    workspaces: []
```

At this point, with just the **serial_number** and **system** defined: our robot is just the standard **Husky A200** platform, and looks like this:

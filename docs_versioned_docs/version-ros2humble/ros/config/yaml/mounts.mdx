Most sensors can use similar mounting structures. Therefore, we want to keep mounts separate from sensors, such that users could attach their own sensors to existing mounts.

## Riser

A mounting plate with the defined number of rows and columns of the PACS™ **80 mm X 80 mm** grid.

:::warning not available without pacs:
At this time, you will **need to use the PACS™ top plate**, only available using the `a200.top_plate` with `model: pacs`, to add these riser mounts. See the [**platform**](./platform.mdx) section for more information.
:::

### Preset Risers

These are the most common riser sizes; therefore, we have accurate models of these plates.

#### 8 X 7 Riser

<Riser8x7 />

#### 1 X 7 Riser

<Riser1x7 />

### Custom Risers

To promote flexibility, the size of the risers can be changed to any size; however, there are no models for these, and instead will be generated using primitives.

For example, we can add a riser with a 4 by 4 grid:

<Riser4x4 />

## Bracket

Brackets are small plates with **80 mm X 80 mm** screw holes that can be used to attach it to the PACS™ gird. They come in three different models.

The **horizontal** and **vertical** models have screw holes to attach all small sensors such as camera, lidars, and IMUs.

The **large** model has screw holes to attach larger sensors such as the SwiftNav Duro receivers.

### Horizontal Bracket

<BracketHorizontal />

### Vertical Bracket

<BracketVertical />

### Large Bracket

<BracketLarge />

## Fath Pivot

Camera mounts with a single joint that can be adjusted to change the pitch of the camera. The angle of the joint is set using the **angle** parameter.

<FathPivot />

## SICK Mounts

These mounts are specifically designed to mount SICK LiDARs, but can be used for other sensors if required.
The orientation of the LiDAR on the mount can be set to either `upright` or `inverted`

### Upright

<SickUpright />

### Inverted

<SickInverted />

## Post

Posts are vertical extrusion rails to where sensors can be added.

These can be single, dual, and quad legs.

### Single

<PostSingle />

### Dual

<PostDual />

### Quad

<PostQuad />

## Disk

Disk plates are used for circular sensors, such as the Velodyne LiDARs.

<Disk />

We can also lift the **disk** by using a **post**.

<DiskPost />

## Sample

<details><summary>Sample A200 Mounts Section</summary>

  <figure>
    <img
      src={require("../img/husky_accessories_0.png").default}

    <figcaption>Husky A200 with Covered User Bay</figcaption>
  </figure>

In this sample, we will add a **bracket** to mount a LiDAR to the front of the **Husky A200**.

We select the **_top_plate_mount_d1_**, in other words, the middle (**d**), front (**1**), 80 mm X 80 mm mounting location on the **PACS** top plate.

```yaml
bracket:
  - parent: top_plate_mount_d1
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    model: horizontal
```

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src={require("../img/husky_mounts_0.png").default}
      width="500"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky A200 with D1 Bracket</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Then, we want to add a camera to the sensor arch. However, we will complicate things by adding it upside down to the extrusion.

We choose a **fath_pivot** mount, and then we set its **parent** to the **_sensor_arch_mount_**.

Using the **xyz** entry, we lower the mount by 21 mm to get it under the sensor arch; then, we roll it by $\pi$ to get it upside down.

```yaml
fath_pivot:
  - parent: sensor_arch_mount # mount atop the sensor arch
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, -0.021] # lower pivot mount to below the sensor arch
    rpy: [3.1415, 0.0, 0.0] # roll pivot mount to flip it upside down
    angle: 0.0
```

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src={require("../img/husky_mounts_1.png").default}
      width="500"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky A200 with upside down Fath Pivot Mount</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Since we did not need a riser, we leave that section empty; the resulting **mounts** section:

```yaml
mounts:
  bracket:
    - parent: top_plate_mount_d1
      xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
      rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
      model: horizontal
  fath_pivot:
    - parent: sensor_arch_mount
      xyz: [0.0, 0.0, -0.021]
      rpy: [3.1415, 0.0, 0.0]
      angle: 0.0
  riser: []
  sick: []
  post: []
  disk: []
```

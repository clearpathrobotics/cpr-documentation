Most sensors can use similar mounting structures. Therefore, we want to keep mounts separate from sensors, such that users could attach their own sensors to existing mounts.

The following **mounts** are available:

- **riser:** a plate with the defined number of rows and columns of an **80mm x 80mm** grid.

```yaml
riser:
  - parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rows: 4 # rows of 80mm x 80mm grid
    columns: 4 # columns of 80mm x 80mm grid
    thickness: 0.00635
```

- **bracket:** a small **100mm x 100mm** plate with **80mm x 80mm** screw holes to attach it to the grid. It comes with hole patterns to attach all supported small sensors.

```yaml
bracket:
  - parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    model: horizontal # or large or vertical
```

- **fath_pivot:** generally a camera mount on a single axis that can be adjusted to change the pitch of the camera.

```yaml
fath_pivot:
  - parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    angle: 0.0 # in radian
```

- **sick:** are mounts specifically designed to mount SICK LiDARs. The orientation of the LiDAR on the mount can be set to either `upright` or `inverted`.
```yaml
sick:
  - parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    model: inverted # or upright
```

- **post:** are vertical extrusion rails to which sensors can be added.
```yaml
post:
  - parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    model: single # or dual or quad
    spacing: 0.08 # distance between multiple posts if model is dual or quad
    height: 0.075 # height of post
```

- **disk:** are circular plates which are used to mount circular sensors, i.e. the Velodyne
```yaml
disk:
  - parent: base_link
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

# Sample

    />
    <figcaption>Husky A200 with Covered User Bay</figcaption>
  </figure>

In this sample, we will add a **bracket** to mount a LiDAR to the front of the **Husky A200**.

We select the **_top_plate_mount_d1_**, i.e. the middle (**d**), front (**1**), 80mm x 80mm mounting location on the **pacs** top plate.

```yaml
bracket:
  - parent: top_plate_mount_d1
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    model: horizontal
```

  <figure>
    <img
      src={require("../img/husky_mounts_0.png").default}
      width="500"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky A200 with D1 Bracket</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Then, we want to add a camera to the sensor arch. However, we will complicate things by adding it upside down to the extrusion.

We choose a **fath_pivot** mount, and then we set its **parent** to the **_sensor_arch_mount_**.

Using the **xyz** entry, we lower the mount by 21mm to get it under the sensor arch; then, we roll it by PI to get it upside down.

```yaml
fath_pivot:
  - parent: sensor_arch_mount # mount atop the sensor arch
    xyz: [0.0, 0.0, -0.021] # lower pivot mount to below the sensor arch
    rpy: [3.1415, 0.0, 0.0] # roll pivot mount to flip it upside down
    angle: 0.0
```

<center>
  <figure>
    <img
      src={require("../img/husky_mounts_1.png").default}
      width="500"
    />
    <figcaption>Husky A200 with upside down Fath Pivot Mount</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Since we did not need a riser, we leave that section empty; the resulting **mounts** section:

```yaml
mounts:
  bracket:
    - parent: top_plate_mount_d1
      xyz: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
      rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
      model: horizontal
  fath_pivot:
    - parent: sensor_arch_mount
      xyz: [0.0, 0.0, -0.021]
      rpy: [3.1415, 0.0, 0.0]
      angle: 0.0
  riser: []
  sick: []
  post: []
  disk: []
```

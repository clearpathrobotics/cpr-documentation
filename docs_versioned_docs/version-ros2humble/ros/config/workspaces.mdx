All ROS packages that are required to be built from source must be built within a ROS workspace. A workspace is directory structure that standardizes and streamlines the build process of ROS packages. See the official ROS 2 Humble workspace documentation for more information. In the following sections, we will cover the steps required to build a workspace.

# Creating a Workspace
As a standard at Clearpath, name the workspace the `colcon_ws` and create it in the home directory.
```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p colcon_ws/src
```

Clone all packages into the source directory, `~/colcon_ws/src`.

# Building a Workspace
Before building the workspace, use `rosdep` to install all required dependencies.
```bash
cd ~/colcon_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r
```

The `--from-paths` argument defines the source directory where the packages that were installed from source are located.
The `--ignore-src` flag indicates that dependencies found within the `--from-paths` directory will be used instead of trying to install binary versions.
The `-r` flag instructs `rosdep` to continue to install found packages even if some are not found or result in errors.

After running the command above, `rosdep` might report errors of missing packages. These packages may need to be installed from source or may not be required to build the package. However, these issues are on a case by case basis.

Once dependencies are installed, it is possible to build the workspace.

It is recommended to install the packages using symbolic links. These links will allow editing the content of file in the `src` packages, such as launch, URDF, or parameter files, without needing to rebuild the workspace. This is done by setting the `--symlink-install` flag.

Furthermore, it is also recommended to build packages from source if debugging is not required. This is done by adding the arguments `--cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.

**Release build with symbolic link install:**
```bash
cd ~/colcon_ws
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

If building a package that has already been installed, it is required to allow overriding the existing version. To do so, use the `--allow-overriding` flag followed by the name of packages to override separated by spaces.

**Release build with symbolic link install that overrides existing packages:**
```bash
cd ~/colcon_ws
colcon build --allow-overriding PKG_NAME_1 [PKG_NAME_2] --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Lastly, it is also possible to build a single package at a time. This is particularly useful when working on a single package that requires rebuilding while several other packages in the workspace do not need to be rebuilt.

**Single package release build with symbolic link install and override:**
```bash
cd ~/colcon_ws
colcon build --packages-select PKG_NAME --allow-overriding PKG_NAME --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

# Source the Workspace
Once the workspace has been built sucessfully, the workspace needs to be sourced before ROS commands can be used to launch any of the nodes of the packages built. To do so:
```bash
source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash
```

It is necessary to source the workspace in every terminal instance. Alternatively, it is recommended to add the sourcing command to the `~/.bashrc` file such that the workspace is automatically sourced whenever a terminal is instantiated.

It is also necessary to add the path to the workspace setup file into the Clearpath configuration file. To do so add the following entry into the `robot.yaml` file:
```yaml
system:
  ros2:
    workspaces:
      - "/home/administrator/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash"
```
Replace `administrator` in the path with the name of the user in whose home directory the workspace was added. For more information on the Clearpth configuration system see the [**Robot YAML**](./yaml/system.mdx) documentation.

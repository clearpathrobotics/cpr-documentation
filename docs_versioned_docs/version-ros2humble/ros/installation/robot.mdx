## Operating System (OS) {#operating-system}

ROS 2 Humble uses [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) as its Tier 1 operating system.
Though other operating systems are supported,
it is highly recommended to use Ubuntu 22.04. For the robot computer, Ubuntu 22.04 Server should be
installed. The server version of the OS will not install a graphical user interface (GUI).

When prompted, set the username to `administrator`.

## Internet Connection

### Wi-Fi

To configure Wi-Fi, first log in to the robot's computer. This can be done by connecting the computer
to a monitor using an HDMI or DisplayPort cable, and connecting a USB keyboard. Power the robot on and
wait for the Ubuntu login prompt to show up.

Once logged in, find the name of your Wi-Fi interface by calling `ip a`. Wi-Fi interface names begin with `wl`.

    <img
      src={require("./img/wifi_interface.jpg").default}
      width="900"
    />
  </figure>
</center>

Next, create the file `/etc/netplan/60-wireless.yaml`, and paste the following contents:

```
network:
  wifis:
    # Replace WIRELESS_INTERFACE with the name of the wireless network device, e.g. wlan0 or wlp3s0
    # Fill in the SSID and PASSWORD fields as appropriate.  The password may be included as plain-text
    # or as a password hash.  To generate the hashed password, run
    #   echo -n 'WIFI_PASSWORD' | iconv -t UTF-16LE | openssl md4 -binary | xxd -p
    # If you have multiple wireless cards you may include a block for each device.
    # For more options, see https://netplan.io/reference/
    WIRELESS_INTERFACE:
      optional: true
      access-points:
        SSID_GOES_HERE:
          password: PASSWORD_GOES_HERE
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp4-overrides:
        send-hostname: true
```

Replace `WIRELESS_INTERFACE` with the name of your Wi-Fi interface, `SSID_GOES_HERE` with your Wi-Fi
SSID, and `PASSWORD_GOES_HERE` with your Wi-Fi password.

Save the file and call `sudo netplan apply` to apply the changes. Check `ip a` again to make sure that
an IP address has been assigned to your Wi-Fi interface.

You should now be able to SSH into the robot by calling `ssh administrator@<robot_ip>` from a remote computer.

:::note

If the Wi-Fi interface indicates down (disabled), enable it using `sudo ip link set dev <interface> up`.
Replace `<interface>` with the name of your disabled Wi-Fi interface.

:::

### Ethernet

The robot's computer can also be connected to a DHCP network over Ethernet. Connect an Ethernet cable
to the built-in Ethernet port on the robot's computer and check that an IP has been assigned with `ip a`.

You should now be able to SSH into the robot by calling `ssh administrator@<robot_ip>` from a remote computer.

## Firmware Update

All platforms with the exception of the A200 will require a firmware update to run ROS 2 Humble.

<ClearpathFirmware />

## Package Install

### Option 1: Install Script

#### Package Sourcing, and Install

```
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_computer_installer/main/install.sh && bash -e install.sh
```

#### Network Configuration

<StandardClearpathBridgeSetup />

For details on setting up custom network interface settings see [Clearpath Computer Setup](../networking/computer_setup.mdx).

#### Robot YAML

The `robot.yaml` file defines the configuration of the robot including the robot model, all
supported accessories and any extra URDF elements or ROS parameters. Information about the Robot YAML
is found in the [Robot Configuration](../config/yaml/overview.mdx) section. This YAML is used to generate the launch,
URDF and ROS parameter files during runtime.

Create your `robot.yaml` file and then copy it into `/etc/clearpath/` and replace the existing file.

#### Start Service

This script used [robot_upstart](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/tree/foxy-devel) to install the `systemd` services
that will launch platform and sensor launch files as background processes.

To start the services, call

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start clearpath-robot.service
```

### Option 2: Manual Source Install

<details><summary>Click to expand the manual source install instructions. Only use this option if you
know what you are doing.</summary>
<p>

#### ROS 2 Humble

Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
for installing ROS 2 Humble from debian packages.

#### Clearpath Package Server

The Clearpath package server needs to be added to the robot computer to access robot packages.

Configure Ubuntu's APT package manager to add the package server:

**1. Install the authentication key for the packages.clearpathrobotics.com repository**

```
wget https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```

**2. Add the debian sources for the repository**

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clearpath-latest.list'
```

**3. Update your computerâ€™s package cache**

```
sudo apt-get update
```

#### Network Configuration

<ComputerNetworkingSetupInstall />

##### Standard Clearpath Bridge

<StandardClearpathBridgeSetup />

For details on setting up custom network interface settings see [Clearpath Computer Setup](../networking/computer_setup.mdx).

#### Clearpath Robot metapackage

Once the Clearpath package server has been added, the [Clearpath Robot](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot)
metapackage can be installed.

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-clearpath-robot
```

Installing this package will also install all dependencies required to run any Clearpath robot and supported sensors,
other than Clearpath firmware packages.

#### Source install

**1. Create a workspace on the robot's computer for the clearpath packages**

```
mkdir ~/clearpath_ws/src -p
```

**2. Import dependencies**

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
sudo apt install python3-vcstool
cd ~/clearpath_ws
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/main/dependencies.repos
vcs import src < dependencies.repos
rosdep install -r --from-paths src -i -y
```

**3. Build packages**

```
colcon build --symlink-install
```

**4. Link the workspace**

Add the following line to your `~/clearpath_ws/src/clearpath_robot/clearpath_robot/scripts/generate` file,
right under where ROS is sourced:

```
source /home/administrator/clearpath_ws/install/setup.bash
```


:::note

This workspace will also need to be sourced in your [robot.yaml](#robot-yaml) file as described
in the [ROS2 Environment](../config/yaml/system.mdx#ros-2-environment) section.

:::

#### Setup folder

Create the setup folder where the [robot.yaml](../config/yaml/overview.mdx) file will be stored, and where files will be generated:

```
sudo mkdir /etc/clearpath/ -p && sudo chmod 777 /etc/clearpath/
```
#### Robot YAML

The `robot.yaml` file defines the configuration of the robot including the robot model, all
supported accessories and any extra URDF elements or ROS parameters. Information about the Robot YAML
is found in the [Robot Configuration](../config/yaml/overview.mdx) section. This YAML is used to generate the launch,
URDF and ROS parameter files during runtime.

Create your `robot.yaml` file and then copy it into `/etc/clearpath/`.

#### Robot services

Clearpath robot services can now be installed with the following command:

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run clearpath_robot install
sudo systemctl enable clearpath-robot
```

This script uses [robot_upstart](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/tree/foxy-devel) to install the `systemd` services
that will launch platform and sensor launch files as background processes.

To start the services, call

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start clearpath-robot.service
```

Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file to automatically source the generated `setup.bash` file in new terminals:

```
source /etc/clearpath/setup.bash
```

#### Additional settings

Certain sensors may require additional setup, please review the [Accessories](../../robots/accessories/accessories.mdx) pages
for any additional instructions for the sensors that you are using. For example, the Blackfly camera has additional instructions
listed under [software bringup](../../robots/accessories/sensors/cameras/flir_blackfly_s#software-bringup).

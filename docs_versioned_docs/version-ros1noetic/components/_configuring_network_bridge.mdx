Your computer is configured to bridge its physical network ports together. This allows any network port to be used
as a connection to the internal `192.168.131.1/24` network for connecting sensors, diagnostic equipment, or
manipulators, or for connecting the your robot to the internet for the purposes of installing updates.

In the unlikely event you must modify your robot's Ethernet bridge, you can do so by editing the configuration
file found at `/etc/netplan/50-clearpath-bridge.yaml`:

```
# Configure the wired ports to form a single bridge
# We assume wired ports are en* or eth*
# This host will have address 192.168.131.1

network:
version: 2
renderer: networkd
ethernets:
bridge_eth:
  dhcp4: no
  dhcp6: no
  match:
    name: eth*
bridge_en:
  dhcp4: no
  dhcp6: no
  match:
    name: en*
bridges:
br0:
  dhcp4: yes
  dhcp6: no
  interfaces: [bridge_en, bridge_eth]
  addresses:
    - 192.168.131.1/24
```

This file will create a bridged interface called `br0` that will have a static address of `192.168.131.1`,
but will also be able to accept a DHCP lease when connected to a wired router. By default, all network
ports named `en*` and `eth*` are added to the bridge. This includes all common wired port names, such as:
`eth0`, `eno1`, `enx0123456789ab`, `enp3s0`, etc.

To include/exclude additional ports from the bridge, edit the match fields, or add additional `bridge_*`
sections with their own match fields, and add those interfaces to the interfaces: `[bridge_en, bridge_eth]`
line near the bottom of the file.

We do not recommend changing the static address of the bridge to be anything other than `192.168.131.1`;
changing this may cause sensors that communicate over Ethernet (e.g. lidars, cameras, GPS arrays) from
working properly.

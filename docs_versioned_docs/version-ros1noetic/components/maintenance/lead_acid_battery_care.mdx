The most damaging thing to a lead-acid battery is a phenomenon called sulfation.
When a lead-acid battery is left in an uncharged state for long periods of time, sulfate
crystals solidify on the electrodes of the battery.
This effect can be permanent, and it causes premature reduction in capacity.
Therefore, it is important to fully charge the battery as soon as you are finished using it,
regardless of how much capacity remains.

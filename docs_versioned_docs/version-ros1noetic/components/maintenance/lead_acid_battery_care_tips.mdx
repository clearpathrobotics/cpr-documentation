In general, following these tips will help maximize the life of the battery:

- Always fully charge the battery as soon as you are finished using it.
- Charge batteries at room temperature. Never charge lead-acid batteries at temperatures above 35Â°C.
- Charge batteries in a well-ventilated area.
- Do not allow the battery to freeze. A low battery will freeze sooner than a fully charged one. Never charge a frozen battery.
- Stored batteries should be topped up every month. Completely cycle batteries every 4 - 6 months.
- At a discharge rate of 50% DOD (depth of discharge), the lifecycle of the battery is 450 - 550 cycles.
  After this point, reduced capacity will be apparent.
- Regularly discharging the battery below 50% DOD will reduce the lifecycle of the battery, sometimes to less than 300 cycles.

Now that you are connected via SSH over a wired connection using the steps above, you can set up your robot's computer
(running Ubuntu 20.04) to connect to a local Wi-Fi network. (For legacy systems running Ubuntu 18.04, use
`wicd-curses` instead.)

<ComponentNetplanSetup />

Now that you know robot's wireless IP address, you may now exit the Ethernet SSH session by executing
`exit`.

Remove the Ethernet cable and close up your robot. Now you can SSH into your robot over the wireless network. To do so,
execute:

`ssh administrator@<IP_OF_ROBOT>`

SSH sessions allow you to control your robot's internal computer. You can do various things such as download packages,
run updates, add/remove files, transfer files etc.

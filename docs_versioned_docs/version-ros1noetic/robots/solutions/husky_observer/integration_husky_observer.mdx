To attach custom hardware to Husky Observer, you will have to take care of mechanical mounting, electrical
supply, and software integration. This guide aims to equip you with respect to these challenges.

## Mechanical Mounting

Husky Observer has two PACS&trade;-compatible mount points on the top of the robot, one at the front
and one at the rear, as outlined in the figures below. Each of the two mount points can support
a payload up to 5 kg.

[PACS&trade;](../../accessories/pacs.mdx) is a Clearpath Robotics standard.
We add a grid of M5x0.8 holes onto the top plate of the robot.
This grid of holes has a 80 mm X 80 mm spacing.
You can create your own brackets to interface with these holes, or can use an existing Clearpath Robotics designed bracket.

:::note

Our [Sensors](../../accessories/sensors/sensors.mdx) and [Accessories](../../accessories/add-ons/add-ons.mdx) pages indicate the required bracket for the particular attachment.

:::note

When using the front and rear mount point, be careful to avoid blocking the field of view of
the 3D LiDAR. If you have any related questions, please contact [Support](#support).

## Electrical Integration

Except for bus-powered USB cameras, most payloads have separate leads for power and data.

### Maintenance and Debugging Connections

On the Husky Observer lid, there are three data interfaces that can be used for system maintenance
and debugging:

- One 1 Gbps Ethernet (RJ45 connector), connected to the Main Computer
- One USB 3.0 (Type A connector), connected to the Main Computer
- One HDMI, connected to the Main Computer

### Custom Payload Connections

On the Husky Observer lid, there is an Icotek KEL-FG-ER-E3 connector with three cable glands that will allow the user to
create and route power cables from custom payloads on the lid to power sources inside the Husky Observer
while still maintaining the IP rating of the robot. (See
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVLlroSRH7E&t=1s&ab_channel=icotek)
for more details on using the Icotek cable glands system.)

Inside the Husky Observer, power is available from terminal blocks as outlined in the table below.
For each power source, 18 AWG wires with ferrules (DigiKey P/N 277-2156-ND) are recommended for power cables
at the end that gets inserted into the terminal blocks. Note that positive and negative wires are connected
to separate terminal blocks.

| Power Source          | Maximum Current | Terminal Blocks                    |
| :-------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| VBAT (24.0 V minimum) | 3.75 A          | Brown (positive), Black (negative) |
| 24 V                  | 2.5 A           | Grey (positive), Black (negative)  |
| 12 V                  | 3.5 A           | White (positive), Black (negative) |

In addition to the power connections, the cable glands can be used to make data connections to
available ports on the Ethernet switch or to available USB ports on the Main Computer. When
connecting a device to the Ethernet switch, the device should be configured with a static IP
address in the 192.168.131.80 to 192.168.131.89 range.

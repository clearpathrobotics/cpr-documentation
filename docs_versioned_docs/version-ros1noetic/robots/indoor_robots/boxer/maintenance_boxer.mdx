## Battery care

To help extend the life of the batteries, follow the steps below.

- Do not discharge the batteries lower than 10%.
  Batteries lower than 5% are permanently damaged and cannot be recharged.
- Recharge batteries to 100% after every use.
- Recharge batteries and turn the circuit breaker to ”OFF” before putting the system into long-term storage.
- Batteries that are in long-term storage will need to be recharged every 6 months.
- Charge batteries when the ambient temperature is between 20 °C to 30 °C.
  Consult Clearpath Robotics if you need to charge batteries outside these conditions.

## Software Maintenance {#software_maintenance}

Boxer is always being improved, both its own software and the many community ROS packages upon which it
depends! You can use the apt package management system to receive new versions all software running on the
platform.

### Updating the Base Unit

OTTO Motors periodically releases updates for the OTTO 100, which can be applied to Boxer's Base Unit.

Please refer to [OTTO Motors' documentation](https://docs.ottomotors.com/en/30495-30532-installing-robot-software.html)
for details on applying software updates.

At the time of writing, the latest version of the OTTO 100 software supported by the Boxer's Noetic backpack is 2.22.3.

### Updating the Backpack Computer

The Backpack Computer can be updated by connecting it to the internet, either using a wired or wireless connection, and
running the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

If you see any errors, contact [Support](#support).

### Starting From Scratch

If Boxer's computer has become inoperable, or for any reason you want to restore it to the factory state, you can
reinstall the operating system by following the steps outlined [Boxer Backpack Computer Software Setup](./tutorials_boxer#boxer-software-setup).

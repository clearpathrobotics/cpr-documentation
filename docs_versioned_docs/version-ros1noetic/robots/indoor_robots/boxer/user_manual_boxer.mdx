## Introduction

Boxer is a large indoor mobile robot for prototyping and development of industrial applications.
Adapted from the OTTO Motors _OTTO 100 autonomous mobile robot (AMR)_, Boxer is programmable
and easily extensible with additional hardware.

:::note

Current Boxer shipments are based on OTTO 100 V2.5. Some shipments from 2021-2023 are based on
OTTO 100 V2.4. All information in this manual applies equally to both versions except where
otherwise noted.

:::

<ComponentSafetyWarning />

### Shipment Contents

Your Boxer shipment contains the following:

- Clearpath Robotics Boxer
- OTTO 100 Manual Charger
- Handheld Joystick Controller
- Optional: OTTO 100 Fast Charger

If you elected to purchase standard payload modules or custom integration services with Boxer, then additional equipment will be included per your specific configuration, plus further documentation as required.

### Hardware Overview

#### System Architecture

Boxer is built on the OTTO 100 AMR, which provides the core locomotion, safety, and sensing capabilities, along with a ROS 2 API
for control of the system. Boxer is typically augmented with a Backpack Computer, which allows for user software to be installed
and executed on the system, controlling the Base Unit through the ROS 2 API over a local Ethernet connection. The backpack
computer also allows for control and monitoring of any additional payloads added to Boxer.

#### Exterior Features

Below is an overview of the Boxer robot hardware that outlines the key components that you should be aware of in order to get started
with using your robot. Note that the front emergency stop button is only present on Boxer V2.5.

<!-- TODO: add picture of front estop when available. -->

#### Body Lights

Boxer includes RGB LED strips around its body. These lights express system status according to the table below.

| LED Pattern   | System State                                                                |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Solid Red     | Robot is starting up                                                        |
| Flashing Red  | Robot is emergency stopped or safety stopped                                |
| Circling Blue | Base Unit is in Manual mode, allowing it to be controlled via the ROS 2 API |

At present these lights are not controllable through any ROS topics.

#### Orientation References

The reference frame used by all Clearpath Robotics ground robots is based on ISO 8855
When commanded with a positive translational velocity (forward), wheels travel in the positive X-direction.
The direction of the axes differs from those used for roll, pitch, and yaw in aircraft, and care should be taken to ensure that data is interpreted correctly.

        width="600"
      />
    </center>
10. You have finished onfiguring the Boxer Base Unit, and it's ready for use.

### Backpack Computer Configuration

This section outlines how to configure the Backpack Computer attached to the Base Unit.
You can omit this section if your Boxer is not equipped with a Backpack Computer.

The Backpack Computer is an add-on computer that is networked with the Base Unit's computer, located inside then Boxer.
This Backpack Computer can be used to integrate peripherals, like sensors and manipulators.
A ROS bridge automatically runs upon booting the Backpack Computer, and transmits the Base Unit computer's ROS data to the Backpack Computer.
This ROS bridge allows you to leverage the Base Unit for your own application.
The Backpack Computer uses Netplan as its network configuration tool, and has a static IP address of <192.168.131.1>.

#### Connecting to the Backpack Computer

You can connect to the Backpack Computer on Boxer over a wired or Wi-Fi connection.

To connect to the Backpack Computer over a wired connection:

1.  Configure a network port on your laptop with the IP address <192.168.131.100>.
2.  Connect a network cable from your laptop to an open network port on the Backpack Computer.
3.  Test the connection between the user computer and Backpack Computer by opening a terminal and entering: `ping 192.168.131.1 `
4.  From your laptop's terminal, you can access the Backpack Computer by entering: `ssh administrator@192.168.131.1`

To connect to the Backpack Computer over a Wi-Fi connection:

1. Connect your laptop to the same Wi-Fi network as the Backpack Computer.
2. Note the IP address of the Backpack Computer's wireless interface by running this command the Backpack Computer's terminal: `ip a`
3. To test the connection between your laptop and Backpack Computer, enter this command in a terminal from your laptop: `ping <wireless_ip_address>` (eg. `ping 192.168.0.11`)
4. From your laptop's terminal, you can access the Backpack Computer by entering: `ssh administrator@<wireless_ip_address>` (eg. `ssh administrator@192.168.0.11`)

#### Connecting the Backpack Computer to a Wi-Fi Network

To connect the Backpack Computer to a wireless network follow these steps:

1.  Access the Backpack Computer over an SSH connection.
    Since the Backpack Computer is presumably not connected to a Wi-Fi network yet, you will need to access the Backpack Computer over a wired connection.
    The previous section details how to connect to the Backpack Computer over a wired connection.
2.  Once you have accessed the Backpack Computer, create a netplan configuration by running the following command.

        sudo touch /etc/netplan/60-wifi.yaml

    This will create a file called _60-wifi.yaml_ inside of the _/etc/netplan/_ directory.

3.  Open _/etc/netplan/60-wifi.yaml_ with your favourite text editor and populate it.
    Use this example configuration file as reference:

    ```
    network:
      wifis:
        # change wlp2s0 to exactly match your wireless interface
        # common values are wlp2s0, wlp3s0, wlan0, etc...
        # if you aren't sure, use the `iwconfig` or `ip a` command
        wlp2s0:
          optional: true
          access-points:
            # replace "my-ssid" with the SSID of your wireless network
            my-ssid:
              # put your wireless password here
              password: wifi_password_goes_here
          # DHCP4 should be enabled for most wireless routers
          # alternatively you can use a static IP address.
          # e.g, uncomment the following
          #addresses: [192.168.1.100/24]
          #gateway: 192.168.1.1
          #dhcp4: false
          dhcp4: true
          dhcp4-overrides:
            send-hostname: true
    ```

4.  Connect the Backpack Computer to the wireless network by running the command below.
    Note that this may take a moment to complete:

    ```
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

5.  To verify that the Backpack Computer is connected to the wireless network, check that the Backpack Computer has an IP address assigned to its wireless interface by running:

    ```
    ip a
    ```

### Battery Charging

The system can be charged using an [OTTO 100 Manual Charger](https://ebikes.ca/product-info/grin-products/cycle-satiator.html) or an [OTTO 100 Fast Charger](https://docs.ottomotors.com/en/84902-86097-100-fast-charger.html).
Details for use and installation are provided in the linked User Manuals.

Only use the OTTO 100 Manual Charger or OTTO 100 Fast Charger provided with your Boxer.
Use of other chargers may cause damage or injury.

        width="200"
      />
    </center>
    <center>
      <img
        src="/img/robot_images/boxer_images/robot_boxer_14.png"
        width="200"
      />
    </center>
3.  Using the base Boxer's hostname or static IP, open the OTTO App by entering the following in your laptop's web-browser:

        http://<hostname>:5000

4.  You are now ready to start driving your system.

### Driving Manually

To drive the robot manually, follow the steps below.

1.  Power up the robot and connect to the OTTO App at `http://<hostname>:5000`
2.  The first time after power-up, it is necessary to take the system out of neutral by clicking on the joystick icon at the bottom right of the interface.
    <center>
      <img
        src="/img/robot_images/boxer_images/robot_boxer_15.png"
        width="600"
      />
    </center>
3.  Ensure that the system is in manual mode and use the _thumbstick_ at the bottom right of the interface to drive the robot in the desired direction.
    Note that the maximum speed can be adjusted using the slider _Tortoise-Hare_ at the bottom of the interface.
    We recommended you begin at slow speeds until you become comfortable with how to control the robot.
    <center>
      <img
        src="/img/robot_images/boxer_images/robot_boxer_16.png"
        width="600"
      />
    </center>

### Mapping

Prior to navigating autonomously, a map of the facility must be created.
The details of creating a map are beyond the scope of this document.
Detailed instructions for mapping can be found here:

- [OTTO App training](https://otto.talentlms.com/)

### Connecting and Using the Controller {#controller}

To use your controller, it must be paired with your Boxer and powered on.
If your purchased the Backpack Computer from Clearpath Robotics, your controller is already paired with your Boxer.
If your controller has become unpaired or if you wish to pair a new controller, following the instructions in the
[Boxer Tutorials](tutorials_boxer.mdx#pairing-the-controller).

To use the controller:

1.  Power up the robot and connect to the OTTO App at `http://<hostname>:5000`
2.  The system will boot up into a neutral state.
    Take the robot out of _Neutral_ by clicking the _Joystick_ icon at the bottom right of the interface.
3.  Release all emergency stop buttons and press the emergency stop reset button.
4.  Press the PS button on the controller to sync with the robot.
    Once the blue LED on the top of the controller is solid, the Robot is paired and ready to move.
    Hold the L1 trigger button to engage the enable switch.
    Push the left thumbstick in the direction you wish to move the Boxer.
5.  For full speed mode, hold the R1 trigger.
    Note that it is recommended that you use full speed mode only when comfortable with the operation of the Boxer.

        width="600"
      />
    </center>

### Using ROS

<ComponentUsingRos />

To quickly get started running ROS with your Boxer follow the instructions below.

Upon booting the Boxer, ROS will begin running on both the Base Unit computer and the Backpack Computer.
The Boxer can be operated using ROS over its ROS topics, and there are two ways of interfacing with Boxer's ROS topics:

1.  SSH into Boxer's Backpack Computer, or
2.  Setting the Boxer's Backpack Computer as the ROS Master on a local computer.

You can SSH into the Boxer's Backpack Computer by connecting a network cable directly between your PC and an open network port
on the Backpack Computer. Configure your computer to have a static IP address on the `192.168.131.0/24` subnet, for
example `192.168.131.100`>`. Once this is done you can log into the robot by running:

```
ssh administrator@192.168.131.1
```

If your laptop is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the Boxer, you can SSH into the Backpack Computer using the robot's IP address on the Wi-Fi network (e.g. `192.168.1.11`)
You may need to SSH over a wired connection and use the `ip a` command to determine what Wi-Fi address has been assigned to the Backpack Computer.

```
ssh administrator@<computer ip>
```

The ROS topics on Boxer can be seen by running:

```
rostopic list
```

Data from sensors such as the camera, internal IMU, front laser, and rear laser can be seen with:

```
rostopic echo /realsense/depth/image_rect_raw
rostopic echo /imu/module0/data
rostopic echo /front/scan
rostopic echo /rear/scan
```

Boxer can be driven using its kinematic controller by publishing drive commands to the `/cmd_vel` ROS topic.
For example, to drive Boxer forward slowly:

```
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear
x: 0.1
y: 0.0
z: 0.0
angular:
x: 0.0
y: 0.0
z: 0.0"
-r 10
```

Boxer can be visualized and controlled through RViz.
On you laptop, set the Boxer's Backpack Computer as the ROS Master, and run the following command to view Boxer in RViz.

```
roslaunch boxer_viz view_robot.launch
```

RViz allows you to interactively drive Boxer around.
Note that the Boxer-specific packages must be installed and sourced on your laptop before to running the command, otherwise, Boxer will not load correctly in RViz.

To restart ROS without having to reboot the Boxer:

```
sudo systemctl restart ros
sudo systemctl restart ros-bridge
```

## Safety Considerations {#safety}

Clearpath Robotics is committed to high standards of safety.
The Boxer robot contains several features to protect the safety of users and the integrity of the vehicle.

### General Warnings

Use of an autonomous robot is inherently dangerous.

For the safety of yourself and others, always conduct initial experiments and software development with
the robot raised off the ground. Place a wooden crate, a set of sawhorses, a sturdy storage tub, or any
other solid flat structure under Boxer to keep the wheels clear of the
ground ("up on blocks").

When starting out, favour slower wheel speeds.
Operating at such speeds will allow for more reaction time in the case of unexpected behaviour.

When the robot is operating, keep clear of the wheels.

Refer to the [OTTO 100 V2.5 Operation and Maintenance Manual](https://docs.ottomotors.com/PDFs/100-v2.5-OMM.pdf) for further safety precautions when using self-driving vehicles.

### Emergency Stop Buttons {#boxer-stop-buttons}

:::warning

Ensure the emergency stop buttons are accessible at all times.
Avoid mounting payloads that extend over the front or rear of Boxer and would occlude the emergency stop buttons.

:::

Please take time to locate the red emergency stop buttons on the front (V2.5 only) and rear and of the system.
The emergency stop function allows a person in the physical vicinity of the robot to halt its motion and prevent re-initiation of motion.
This emergency stop system is intended for use in emergency situations.
The emergency stop system should not be used as the means of controlling robot motion during regular operation.

When any emergency stop button is pressed, it provides a secure way to stop the robot movement, but does not control power attached by the attachment panel.
The emergency stop function can be reset by pulling out all the red emergency stop buttons until they return to an extended position and then pressing the emergency stop reset button.
The robot may begin moving again immediately after the emergency stop reset button has been pressed.

When in emergency stop mode, the light strip will be flashing red and Boxer will not drive.
The commands received during emergency stop mode are not buffered; Boxer will always act on the latest commands received.
This means that if the commands are stopped before the stop is released, the Boxer will not move.
If the commands are continued, Boxer will move at the speed commanded once the stop is released.

### Safety Lidars

Boxer is also equipped with safety lidars in the front and back that will cause the robot to lose power if a collision is predicted,
or if the robot is operating too fast in an enclosed environment. The safety stop is automatic, and is not controlled through any ROS
topics. Once the danger has passed the safety stop will automatically disengage.

If Boxer seems to be stuck in a safety stop, check that there is no dirt or debris on either the front or rear lidars. Wipe the
lidars down using an appropriate lidar wipe or soft cloth to remove any dirt.

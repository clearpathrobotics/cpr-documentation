These pages outline the hardware and software steps required to get manipulators installed on your Clearpath robot.
This documentation should be considered a quick reference, rather than a complete technical data package from the manipulator's Original Equipment Manufacturer.

Also note that we have only listed the documentation of our most commonly used manipulators.

We suggest you:

1. Review our documentation of the manipulators related to your robot integration.
2. Review the related Further Reading section.
3. If you are planning to purchase a manipulator, consider visiting our [Component Store](https://store.clearpathrobotics.com/).
4. If you want Clearpath Robotics to integrate sensors on your robot, contact our Sales team at <sales@clearpathrobotics.com>, whether you want to use a new Clearpath Robotics platform, or reuse your existing vehicle.
5. Contact our Support team at <support@clearpathrobotics.com> if you have any questions.

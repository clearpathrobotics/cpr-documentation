### Step 2: Install the TX2

:::note

Custom mounting brackets are available
[on Github](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/jetson_setup/raw/noetic/models/JetsonTX2HuskyMount.stl).

:::

1. Download and 3D print the mounts. A 0.2 mm layer thickness should be sufficient.

2. Using 4X M3 bolts, attach the plates inside the Husky platform. On the plates, add 4 M3 stand-offs
   to the board mount points. A 6 mm height is recommended.

3. Once the mounts are installed, attach the TX2 onto the mounts using M3 bolts.

4. Take the power cable that powered the ITX computer and plug it into the TX2. Then, attach the serial
   communication cable to the USB port on the TX2. If you have multiple USB peripherals on the robot,
   you may need to use a USB hub.

### Step 1: Put Jetson in Recovery Mode (TX2 and Xavier AGX only)

:::caution
This step is not required for Jetson Nano
:::

Put the Jetson into recovery mode by following these steps:

1.  Connect the Jetson to the computer onto which SDK Manager will be installed (see next step) using the provided microUSB cable.
2.  Make sure the Jetson is powered off.
3.  Connect a monitor, mouse, and keyboard to the Jetson. (The mouse is optional, but recommended.
    If you do not have an all-in-one mouse+keyboard you will need to use a small USB hub, as the
    Jetson only has a single USB port.)
4.  Press and hold the REC button.
5.  Press the power button.

### Step 2A: Download and Install Nvidia's SDK Manager (TX2 and Xavier AGX only)

:::caution
This step is not required for Jetson Nano
:::

1. Download the appropriate version of [Nvidia's SDK Manager](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager)
   onto the computer connected to the Jetson.

   :::note

   SDK Manager is used for installing software on the Jetson from the host computer.
   If using Jetson TX2, only JetPack 4.x is supported and the host computer will need to have Ubuntu 16.04 or
   Ubuntu 18.04 installed. If using Jetson Xavier Nano/AGX, JetPack 5.x is supported and the host computer will need
   to have Ubuntu 18.04 or Ubuntu 20.04 installed.

   :::

2. Install the SDK Manager by running the following commands:

   ```
   cd <folder where you downloaded SDK manager>
   sudo dpkg -i sdkmanager_<version>_amd64.deb
   ```

   :::note
   If your system is missing dependencies you may see error messages in the output of the `dpkg` command.
   To resolve these, run `sudo apt-get -f install`.
   :::

3. Login the the SDK Manager using your Nvidia developer credentials.

4. Specify the Hardware Configuration. You do not need to setup your Host Machine unless you are planning on
   doing Cuda work on your local computer. This can usually be disabled. Under the Target Hardware, make sure
   to choose TX2 or Xavier AGX to match your hardware. Once complete, click "Continue to Step 02".

5. Accept the terms. Make sure the Download and Target directories are in locations that you have write-access
   to and that your hard drive has enough space for the files. Click "Continue to Step 03".

### Step 2B: Install Image on SD Card (Nano only)

:::caution
This step is not required for Jetson Xavier AGX or TX2
:::

1. Download the latest version of the
   [Nano SD Image](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-nano-sd-card-image).

2. Download the latest version of [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

       />
       <figcaption>Download in progress</figcaption>
     </figure>
   </center>

3. Use Etcher to flash the image onto your SD card.

4. Install the SD card into the Nano and power up the Nano.

### Step 3: Configure the Installation

1. Make sure to plug a keyboard and monitor into the Jetson. On first boot,
   it will go through the usual Ubuntu setup steps. Accept the Licenses.

     </figure>
   </center>

5. Specify a hostname, username, and password for the machine.

   :::note
   For compatibility with older versions of the Jetson software, set the username and
   password to `nvidia`. To standardize with other Clearpath Robotics products, set the
   username to `administrator` and the password to `clearpath`.

       <figcaption>Specifying your hostname, username, and password</figcaption>
     </figure>
   </center>

6. (**Nano only**): If prompted for a partition size, use the default size, which should fill the
   whole SD card. Make sure it matches the maximum possible size, unless you have other plans
   for that space.

       />
       <figcaption>Waiting for remaining packages</figcaption>
     </figure>
   </center>

8. Once the OS is setup, you will be brought to the desktop.

       />
       <figcaption>Post-install desktop</figcaption>
     </figure>
   </center>

9. Open a terminal and run `ifconfig` or `ip a` to see the IP address it is using. You will
   need to connect it to network through wireless or ethernet.

       <img

       />

     </figure>
   </center>

### Step 4: Install Extra SDK Components (TX2 and Xavier AGX only)

:::caution
This step is not required for Jetson Nano
:::

1. Back in your host computer, it will be waiting to install the extra SDK components on your Jetson.
   Enter the username, password, and IP address you found above.

   <center>
     <figure>
       <img
         src="/img/computer_images/jetson/software/tx2/14.png"
         width="800"
       />
       <figcaption>Installing SDK components</figcaption>
     </figure>
   </center>

2. The install will connenct to the remote Jetson over the network. It will continue the install
   by transferring the files and install them.

     <figure>
       <img
         src="/img/computer_images/jetson/software/tx2/15.png"
         width="800"
       />
       <figcaption>Waiting for SDK component installation</figcaption>
     </figure>
   </center>

3. You can check the terminal window to see the progress of individual commands. This process will
   take a while, so it can be nice to verify that the process isn't stalled.

   <center>
     <figure>
       <img
         src="/img/computer_images/jetson/software/tx2/16.png"
         width="800"
       />
       <figcaption>Installation terminal view</figcaption>
     </figure>
   </center>

4. Once the process is done, you can click FINISH to close the window.

   <center>
     <figure>
       <img
         src="/img/computer_images/jetson/software/tx2/17.png"
         width="800"
       />
       <figcaption>Installation complete</figcaption>
     </figure>
   </center>

### Step 5: Configure for Use with your Clearpath Robot

1. Once the OS has been written to the Jetson, log into it and run the following commands to configure
   it for use with your Clearpath robot:

   ```
   wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clearpathrobotics/ros_computer_setup/main/install.sh && bash install.sh
   ```

   :::note
   If `curl` is not installed on your Jetson by default you can install it by running `sudo apt-get install curl`.
   :::

   <center>
     <figure>
       <img
         src="/img/computer_images/jetson/software/tx2/18.png"
         width="800"
       />
       <figcaption>ROS Computer Setup</figcaption>
     </figure>
   </center>

   These commands will download and install ROS along with the necessary `apt` packages to get your robot up and running.
   Depending on your network speed it may take a long time for everything to install. Reboot the Jetson after these commands
   are done to complete the configuration.

2. When the Jetson starts up again, it should be connected to the robot. To see that the robot is connected by opening a
   terminal and executing `rostopic echo /status`. You should see a 1 Hz message containing the robot's diagnostic
   information.

   Your Jetson should now be configured to operate as the robot's main computer.

### Step 6: Pair a PS4 Controller with your Clearpath Robot (Optional)

:::note
This step is optional.

<ComponentPs4ControllerPairing />

### Step 7: Use Remote Computer with Jetson (Optional)

:::note
This step is optional.
:::

To use your Remote Computer (eg. laptop) with the Jetson, note the IP address of the Jetson, install the robot-specific
desktop packages on the Remote Computer, at set up your Remote Computer to use the Jetson as the ROS master.
Refer to the "Installing Remote Computer Software" section of your robot User Manual for details.

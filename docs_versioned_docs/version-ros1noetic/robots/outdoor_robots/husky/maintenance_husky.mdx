## Chassis

Husky is an all-terrain robot, but it is not waterproof.
Care should be taken that no part of the main chassis is ever submerged in water.
When the chassis becomes wet or dirty, wipe it down with a damp cloth and dry with a towel.

If water is suspected to have entered the Husky A200 chassis, remove the battery and allow Husky to fully dry
for a minimum of 24 hours.

:::note

Clearpath Robotics offers a Waterproofing Kit for Husky.
This includes a top cover for the user bay, sealed drivetrain bearings, and rubber foam tape on all the panel seams.

## Checking Drivetrain Health

Depending on the environment in which the robot is used in and duty cycle,
the robot drivetrain may require maintenance during its life. Maintenance
activities can include gearhead replacement, tire tread replacement, motor
brush replacement, belt replacement, bearing replacement, etc.

It is recommended that the user perform an auditory inspection of the
robot drivetrain once per month. Take note of any clicking, grinding or
irregular skipping sounds while the robot is moving. Note that some clicking
in the gearheads is normal during stops and starts, due to backlash between
the gears.

---

## Wheels

Tire pressure may change with temperature and should be checked monthly
with a pressure gauge. Inspecting tires, releasing pressure, and inflating
tires are completed through the tire's inflation stem.
Tire pressure should not exceed 137 kPa (20 psi), and lower pressure may be desired based on terrain requirements.
A monthly visual inspection of the tire treads is also recommended.
Replacement wheel assemblies can be purchased from Clearpath Robotics and
can be installed by the user.

:::tip

Husky's wheels can handle a range of different terrains, but work best when inflated to the proper pressure.
Lower tire pressures, for example 68.5 kPa (10 psi), ensure better traction in rough and varied terrain, where rocks
or other obstacles may be encountered. This has the adverse effect of lowering drivetrain efficiency and decreasing
battery charge, so high pressures up to a maximum of 137 kPa (20 psi) should be used when driving on flat surfaces.

Lower tire pressuses also reduce the effective diameter of the wheel, and will impact your odometry readings.
Odometry is calculated using the average diameter of a tire inflated to 137 kPa (20 psi).

## Lead-Acid Battery Care

Husky's default power supply is a sealed 24 V lead-acid battery (VRLA), providing 20 Ah of charge.
These tips are intended to help keep your Husky Lead-Acid Battery in tip-top shape.
With proper maintenance, the battery should maintain the majority of its capacity for hundreds of cycles.

<ComponentLeadAcidBatteryCare />

Your robot's battery charger works in 3 stages:

1.  Constant current charging
2.  Topping charge
3.  Float charge

The bulk of the capacity (70%) is regained during the first stage.

It is important to let the charger complete all 3 stages whenever possible, to help maintain the life of the battery.
The initial stage will take 5 - 7 hours, and a complete charge may take up to 14 hours.

## Lithium Battery Care

If your Husky has an upgrade to lithium batteries, note the required maintenance below.

### Balancing Lithium Batteries

The Husky's batteries must be balanced on a regular basis to ensure accurate
feedback, consistent performance, and long life. If the batteries are
allowed to fall out of balance, they will become unevenly loaded. This can
lead to back-feeding between batteries, reduced charge-holding capacity
for the system as a whole, and increased stress on both batteries.
If the imbalance becomes severe enough, one of the system batteries
will enter a protective state and disconnect itself from the system.
Once the battery enters this state there is a limited time window to
recover it. If that window expires the battery will become irreversibly
damaged with no possibility of recovery.

Battery balancing is a slow process that will occur automatically when
the fully-charged batteries are held at their float voltage. Because the
automatic charger will shut off when it determines that the batteries are
fully charged, the system cannot be balanced using the autocharge dock.
The manual charger must be used.

To perform a "quick" balance, leave the robot plugged into the manual
charger overnight. A quick balance is recommended at least once per week.
A full balance of 24+ hours is recommended at least once per month.

Contact Clearpath Robotics for assistance with recovering a battery that
has entered a protective state.

### Checking Lithium Battery Health

A regularly-balanced battery system can be recharged thousands of times
before degrading. Even with good battery maintenance, the battery will
lose capacity over time. This results in reduced runtime and driving
range for your Husky. This translates to reduced run-time and
range. The robot will need to be recharged more frequently and overall
system availability will be reduced.

It is recommended that the system operator review runtime performance
once per year to determine whether battery replacement is required.
Runtime measurements should be taken immediately after a full balancing
operation. Battery replacement is performed by Clearpath Robotics and
is subject to battery availability. Replacement batteries may be
purchased in advance and warehoused at Clearpath for future use.

## Replacing Fuses

You Husky's MCU has fuses that can be changed through the rear battery access panel.
The large battery input fuse is on the other side of the MCU, so you will need to remove Husky's metal panels to access this fuse.

:::caution

Refer to the white lettering on the circuit board for what rating of fuse to replace in the fuse holder.

The [Common Replacement Items](#husky_maintenance_common_replacement_items) section of this page shows where you can purchase new fuses.

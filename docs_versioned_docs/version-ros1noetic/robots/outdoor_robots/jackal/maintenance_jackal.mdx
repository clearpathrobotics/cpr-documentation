### MCU Firmware Update

:::note

Jackal's MCU is mounted to the rear inside wall of the robot. To access it, open the lid, keeping the computer
tray secured to the underside of the lid.

1. The `M_RST` button, used to reset the MCU.
2. The MCU mode switch. Left is `NORM` or normal mode, right is `ALT` used for flashing the firmware.
3. The mini-USB port used for transmitting data. This should be connected to Jackal's PC for both normal operation and firmware flashing.

:::

When you update packages, there is periodically a new version of Jackal's firmware available. You will know this
is the case in one of two ways:

1. The firmware and PC are unable to connect to each other, which will be apparent if the two-arrow comms indicator
   fails to come on after system bootup.
2. The firmware version number in the `/status` message does not match the package version output by
   `dpkg -s ros-noetic-jackal-firmware`. In the future there will be an automated check for this which outputs
   a diagnostics warning when a firmware update is available to be applied.

If new firmware is available, follow the procedure below to flash it to Jackal's MCU:

1. Place Jackal up on blocks. Firmware loading does not usually result in unintended motion, but it's safest when
   off the ground.
2. Ensure that Jackal is powered-on. Open the lid of the robot to expose the MCU.
3. Make sure the mini-USB cable (`3` in the image above) is connected to Jackal's PC.
4. Move the mode switch (`2` in the image above) to `ALT` (right).
5. Press `M_RST` (`1` in the image above) to enter boot loader mode.
6. The MCU is now in bootloader mode, ready to receive new firmware.

Now, from Jackal's PC (connected via SSH or screen/keyboard), execute:

```
rosrun jackal_firmware upload
```

You should see about 20 seconds worth of lines output beginning with `Download from image ...`. When this is
complete perform the following steps to restore normal operation:

1. Move the mode switch back to `NORM` (left).
2. Press `M_RST`. You must perform this step within a few seconds of changing the mode switch. If you take too long Jackal may power down. This is fine and won't harm the robot, but can be annoying.

If the robot powers down, ensure the mode switch is in the `NORM` position and power the robot back on.

Jackal will now be using the new firmware you installed.

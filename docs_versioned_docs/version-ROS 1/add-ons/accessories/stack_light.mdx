:::note

Light Modules are not included in the PACS parts list since the configuration of modules depends on your specific integration.
Refer to the listed Light Modules at the top of this page for common modules.
Refer to [this catalog](/assets/pdf/clearpath_robotics_027220-TDS1.pdf) for all available modules and parts, including strobing lights, and buzzers.

### Instructions

1.  Mount the Mounting Adapter (ID 2) to the attachment-plate (ID 1) using the M4 screws (ID 4) and nuts (ID 5).
    Refer to the [attachment-plate's drawing notes](/assets/pdf/clearpath_robotics_026914.pdf) for what holes to use for mounting the stack light.
2.  Place the Controls Base (ID 3A) onto the assembly and twist 10° clockwise to lock it in place.
3.  Make and connect a cable for controlling the stack light's modules.
    Refer to the [Pinout Section](#stack_light_pinout) above for details.
4.  Mount this assembly onto your robot, using the included spacers (ID 6) and screws (ID 7).
5.  Add light modules onto the assembly and twist 10° clockwise to lock them in place.
    This locking connection creates an IP65 weatherproof seal, and completes the electrical connection to the Controls Base.
6.  Place the Top Cap (ID 3B) onto the assembly and twist 10° to lock it in place.

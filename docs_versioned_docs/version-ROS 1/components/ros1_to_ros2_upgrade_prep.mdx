##### Upgrading Ubuntu OS Version (Optional)

:::note

If you already have Ubuntu 20.04 installed, you can skip this step.

:::

ROS2 specifically targets Ubuntu 20.04; therefore, if your computer is
currently running an older Ubuntu OS version (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04 for ROS1
Melodic, or Ubuntu 16.04 for ROS2 Kinetic), you will need to update it
to Ubuntu 20.04.

The recommended method of installing Ubuntu 20.04 is from an ISO via a
bootable USB drive. The Ubuntu 20.04 ISO can be found from [Ubuntu's
official releases](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/).

On any computer:

1.  Download the `.iso` file from the link above.
2.  Insert a USB drive.
3.  Write the downloaded Ubuntu 20.04 ISO to the USB drive using a
    software such as `Rufus`, `Etcher`, or `UNetbootin`. This will erase
    all data already on the USB drive, so make sure you have backed up
    anything important!

On the computer to be upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04:

1.  Ensure that it is turned off and has internet access via ethernet.
2.  Insert the newly formatted USB drive.
3.  Turn on and choose to boot from the USB drive.
4.  The installer should run automatically. Step through any prompts
    that come up. The computer will turn off automatically when the
    installation completes.
5.  Once the computer turns off, remove the USB drive and turn on the
    computer. It will now be running your fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04.

##### Removing ROS1 Noetic (Optional)

:::note

If ROS1 Noetic was not previously installed, you can skip this step.

:::

If ROS1 Noetic was previous installed and there is a systemd job to
start it on boot, it must be disabled to use ROS2 on boot. This can be
done by running:

```bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
rosrun robot_upstart uninstall ros
```

##### Installing ROS2

<!--- Will eventually need to turn this into "tabs" to support additional ROS2 releases --->

Simply follow the [official ROS2 Foxy installation
instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html) to install
ROS2 Foxy on your Ubuntu 20.04 computer.

If your Ubuntu 20.04 computer for some reason has ROS1 Noetic installed
already, you will just need to `source` the desired ROS version and
distribution before using it.

For example:

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash # Run this command to use ROS2 Foxy
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash # Run this command to use ROS1 Noetic
```

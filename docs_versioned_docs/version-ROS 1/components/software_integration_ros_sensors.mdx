## Software integration

ROS has a large ecosystem of sensor drivers, some of which include pre-made URDF descriptions and even simulation configurations.
Please see the [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors) for a partial list.

For the best experience, consider purchasing supported accessories from [Clearpath Robotics](https://store.clearpathrobotics.com) for your robot, which will include simulation, visualization, and driver support.
We will happily assist you in integrating your own devices as well.

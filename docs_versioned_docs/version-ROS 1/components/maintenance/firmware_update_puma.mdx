#### 1. Tools required:

- A laptop or development computer running Ubuntu.
- An internet connection on your development computer.
- A variety of hand tools to get access to the motor controllers inside your Husky, Dingo, or Ridgeback.
- A cable to connect your computer to the robot's motor controller.
  We use an FTDI TTL-232R-3V3 with it's default pinout.
  You can purchase this cable from Digi-Key as [768-1015-ND](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/ftdi-future-technology-devices-international-ltd/TTL-232R-3V3/1836393).

#### 2. Get the firmware tools from GitHub.

You can download the firmware tool, and the firmware binary file from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/puma-motor-firmware).
Refer to the README inside that repository to decide which binary file you should use for your robot platform and application.

:::note

You can get these tools by using `git clone`, or by using the GitHub's _Download ZIP_ button.

:::

---

#### 3. Get physical access to the motor controllers

Turn off the robot.
Use hand tools to remove panels on your robot so you can get access the motor controllers.

---

#### 4. Connect the cable.

Depending on the robot, you will have 2 or 4 motor controllers installed.
You will need to repeat this installation process for each motor controller, so keep track of which ones you have updated.

Connect the cable with the orientation as shown in the attached image.

:::caution

The wrong orientation will irreparably damage the motor controller.

:::

:::warning

Remove jewlery and similar electrically conductive objects from your hands and arms.
The capacitors on the motor controllers store energy even after the robot is turned off.
Conductive objects that electrically-short the motor controller's terminals can cause shocks or burns to your hands.

:::

:::note

Do not change or remove any of the other components on your motor controllers.

- Switches
- Input power cables
- Motor power cables
- RJ11 communication cables
- DIP switches
- Terminating resistor switch

#### 5. Connect the USB end of the cable to your development computer.

---

#### 6. Place the motor controller in firmware loading mode.

You can do this by pressing the button shown below, and then turning the robot on.
You may release the button 3 seconds after turning the robot on.
Notice that the large _Status LED_ is not turned on.

:::note

The other motor controllers' _Status LEDs_ will be orange since they are not in firmware loading mode.

#### 7. Install the new firmware.

Open a new terminal shell on your development computer.
Navigate to the folder that you cloned of downloaded from GitHub in Step 2.
For example, if you saved the repository to your _Downloads_ folder:

```
cd ~/Downloads/puma-motor-firmware
```

Now install the firmware on the motor controller by running the command:

```
./sflash motor_controller_firmware_husky_001.bin -c /dev/ttyUSB0
```

:::note

Replace `motor_controller_firmware_husky_001.bin` with whatever firmware file you have chosen for your application.

:::

:::tip

You may need change the permissions of the `sflash` program.
You can do this by right-clicking on `sflash` and selecting `properties`.
Change the permissions to `Allow executing file as a program`.

</figure>

Alternatively; you can add execute permissions to sflash using a termainal.
Navigate to the file through a terminal, and running:

```
chmod +x sflash
```

:::

You should see the program running in the terminal window.
You will see the following message when the firmware installation is complete:

```
Application    : motor_controller_firmware_husky_001.bin
Program Address: 0x0
       COM Port: /dev/ttyUSB0
      Baud Rate: 115200
Erasing Flash:
Remaining Bytes: 00000000
Successfully downloaded to device.
```

---

#### 8. Repeat the process for the remaining motor controllers.

You can follow Steps 4 - 7 for the remaining motor controllers.
Make sure you turn off the robot each time.

---

### 9. Reboot the robot and test.

Power-cycle your robot.
Once it has restarted, use a joystick to drive it around.

The robot's dynamics may be very different than what you are familiar with.
The new firmware will change how the motor's react to `/cmd_vel` messages, so you should test in a controlled setting.

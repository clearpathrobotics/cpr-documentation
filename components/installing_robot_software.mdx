There are three methods to install software on the physical robot.

The preferred method is using the Clearpath Robotics ISO image, which is covered in this section.

The second method is using Debian (.deb) packages, which is also covered in this section.

The final approach is installing from source by directly cloning Clearpath Robotics Github
repositories and building them in your ROS (catkin) workspace; however, this method is not
covered in this section.

##### Install from ISO Image

:::caution

Installing with the Clearpath Robotics ISO image will completely wipe data on the robot's computer, since the ISO image will install Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal), ROS Noetic, and robot-specific packages.

:::

:::note

The Clearpath Robotics ISO image only targets Intel-family computers (`amd64` architecture).
If your robot runs on an Nvidia Jetson computer, see
[Jetson Software](/docs/computers/jetson/jetson_software) for software installation details.

:::

Clearpath provides a lightly customized installation image of Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal" that automatically pulls in all necessary dependencies for the robot software.
To install the software on a physical robot through the Clearpath Robotics ISO image, you will first need a USB drive of at least 2 GB to create the installation media, an ethernet cable, a monitor, and a keyboard.

1.  Download the appropriate [Noetic ISO image](https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/images/latest/noetic-focal/) for your platform.

2.  Copy the image to a USB drive using `unetbootin`, `rufus`, `balena etcher`, or a similar program. For example:

    ```
    sudo unetbootin isofile="clearpath-universal-noetic-amd64-0.4.17.iso"
    ```

3.  Connect your robot computer to internet access (via wired Ethernet), a keyboard, and a monitor.
    Make sure that the robot is connected to shore power (where applicable) or that the robot's battery is fully charged.

    :::warning

    The next step wipes your robot's hard drive, so make sure you have that image [backed up](#performing-a-backup).

    :::

4.  Boot your robot computer from the USB drive and let the installer work its magic. If asked for a partitioning method
    choose `Guided - use entire disk and set up LVM`.

    :::note

    You may need to configure the computer's BIOS to prioritize booting from the USB drive.
    On most common motherboards, pressing `Delete` during the initial startup will open the BIOS for configuration.

    :::

5.  The setup process will be automated and may take a long time depending on the speed of your internet connection.
6.  Once the setup process is complete, the computer will turn off.
    Please unplug the USB drive and turn the computer back on.
7.  On first boot, the username will be `administrator` and the password will be `clearpath`.
    You should use the `passwd` utility to change the `administrator` account password.
8.  To set up a factory-standard robot, ensure all your peripherals are plugged in, and run the following command, which will configure a ros upstart service, that will bring up the base robot launch files on boot.
    The script will also detect any standard peripherals (IMU, GPS, etc.) you have installed and add them to the service.

          <br />
          sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        </code>
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

9.  Finally, start ROS for the first time. In terminal, run:

    ```
    sudo systemctl start ros
    ```

##### Installing from Debian Packages

If you are installing software on a physical robot through Debian packages, you will first
need to ensure that the robot's computer is running Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) and ROS Noetic.

1. Before you can install the robot packages, you need to configure Ubuntu's APT package
   manager to add Clearpath's package server.

   1. Install the authentication key for the packages.clearpathrobotics.com repository. In terminal, run:

      ```
      wget https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
      ```

   2. Add the debian sources for the repository. In terminal, run:

      ```
      sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clearpath-latest.list'
      ```

   3. Update your computer's package cache. In terminal, run:

      ```
      sudo apt-get update
      ```

2. After the robot's computer is configured to use Clearpath's debian package repository,
   you can install the robot-specific packages.

   1. On a physical robot, you should only need the robot packages. In terminal, run:

      <Tabs groupId="ros_versions">
        <TabItem
          value="husky"
          label="Husky"
          default
        >
          <code>sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-robot</code>
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem
          value="jackal"
          label="Jackal"
        >
          <code>sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-jackal-robot</code>
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem
          value="dingo"
          label="Dingo"
        >
          <code>sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-dingo-robot</code>
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem
          value="ridgeback"
          label="Ridgeback"
        >
          <code>sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-ridgeback-robot</code>
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>

   2. Install the `robot_upstart` job and configure the bringup service so that ROS will launch each time the robot starts. In terminal, run:

      <Tabs groupId="ros_versions">
        <TabItem
          value="husky"
          label="Husky"
          default
        >
          <code>
            rosrun husky_bringup install
            <br />
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
          </code>
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem
          value="jackal"
          label="Jackal"
        >
          <code>
            rosrun jackal_bringup install
            <br />
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
          </code>
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem
          value="dingo"
          label="Dingo"
        >
          <code>
            rosrun dingo_bringup install
            <br />
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
          </code>
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem
          value="ridgeback"
          label="Ridgeback"
        >
          <code>
            rosrun ridgeback_bringup install
            <br />
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
          </code>
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>

   3. Finally, start ROS for the first time. In terminal, run:

      ```
      sudo systemctl start ros
      ```

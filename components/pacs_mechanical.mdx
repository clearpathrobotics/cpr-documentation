[PACS](/docs/tools/pacs) is a Clearpath Robotics standard.
We add a grid of M5Ã—0.8 holes onto the top plate of the robot.
This grid of holes has a 80 mm X 80 mm spacing.
You can create your own brackets to interface with these holes, or can use an existing Clearpath Robotics designed bracket.

:::note

Our [Sensors](/docs/sensors) and [Accessories](/docs/accessories) pages indicate the required bracket for the particular attachment.

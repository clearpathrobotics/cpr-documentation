ROS has a large ecosystem of sensor drivers, some of which include pre-made URDF descriptions and
even simulation configurations. Refer to [Sensors supported by ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors).

For the best experience, consider purchasing supported accessories from Clearpath Robotics for your
robot, which will include simulation, visualization, and driver support. Refer to the following

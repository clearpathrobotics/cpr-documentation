If you are upgrading your robot from an older version of ROS, please refer to our upgrade instructions for upgrading to [Melodic](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/kinetic-to-melodic/index.html), [Noetic](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html) and [ROS 2 Humble](/docs/ros/installation/upgrading).

Clearpath Robotics robots are always being improved, both its own software and the many community ROS packages upon which it depends!
You can use the `apt` package management system to receive new versions all software running on the platform.

Each robot leaves the factory already configured to pull packages from http://packages.ros.org as well as http://packages.clearpathrobotics.com.
To update your package and download new package versions, simply run:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

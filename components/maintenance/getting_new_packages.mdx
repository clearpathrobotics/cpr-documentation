### Getting New Packages

Clearpath Robotics robots are always being improved, both its own software and the many community ROS packages upon which it depends!
You can use the `apt` package management system to receive new versions all software running on the platform.

Each robot leaves the factory already configured to pull packages from http://packages.ros.org as well as http://packages.clearpathrobotics.com.
To update your package and download new package versions, simply run:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

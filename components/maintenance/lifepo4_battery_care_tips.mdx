In general, following these tips will help maximize the life of the battery:

- Always fully charge the battery as soon as you are finished using it.
- Charge batteries at room temperature. Never charge LiFEPO4 batteries at temperatures above 45°C or below 0°C.
- Charge batteries in a well-ventilated area.
- Do not allow the battery to freeze. Never charge a frozen battery.
- Stored batteries should be charged and balanced every 4 -6 months.
- At a discharge rate of 50% DOD (depth of discharge), the lifecycle of the battery can be greater than 8000 cycles with an apparent capacity remaining of 70% at that time.
- Regularly discharging the battery to 80% DOD will reduce the lifecycle of the battery, sometimes to less than 3000 cycles with the same apparent capacity remaining.

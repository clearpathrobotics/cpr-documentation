Husky's default power supply is a sealed 24 V lead acid battery pack (VRLA), providing 20 Ah of charge.
These tips are intended to help keep your Husky Lead-Acid Battery in tip-top shape.
With proper maintenance, the battery should maintain the majority of its capacity for hundreds of cycles.

The most damaging thing to a lead-acid battery is a phenomenon called sulfation.
When a lead-acid battery is left in an uncharged state for long periods of time, sulfate
crystals solidify on the electrodes of the battery.
This effect can be permanent, and it causes premature reduction in capacity.
Therefore, it is important to fully charge the battery as soon as you are finished using it,
regardless of how much capacity remains.

Your Husky ships with a three-stage battery charger that completely charges a Husky battery.
Charging occurs in three stages: Constant current, topping charge, and float charge.
The bulk of the capacity (70%) is regained during the first stage.

It is important to let the charger complete all three stages whenever possible, to help maintain the life of the battery.
The initial stage will take 5-7 hours, and a complete charge may take up to 14 hours.

In general, following these tips will help maximize the life of the battery:

- Always fully charge the battery as soon as you are finished using it.
- Charge batteries at room temperature. Never charge lead-acid batteries at temperatures above 35 degrees Celcius.
- Charge batteries in a well-ventilated area.
- Do not allow the battery to freeze. A low battery will freeze sooner than a fully charged one. Never charge a frozen battery.
- Stored batteries should be topped up every month. Completely cycle batteries every 4-6 months.
- At a discharge rate of 50% DOD (depth of discharge), the lifecycle of the Husky battery is 450-550 cycles.
  After this point, reduced capacity will be apparent.
- Regularly discharging the battery below 50% DOD will reduce the lifecycle of the battery, sometimes to less than 300 cycles.

Configuring non-standard peripherals requires a source workspace on the robot computer.

1. Create a new workspace:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/cpr_noetic_ws/src
    ```

2. Add any custom source packages to the `~/cpr_noetic_ws/src` directory.

3. After adding your packages, make sure any necessary dependencies are installed:

    ```bash
    cd ~/cpr_noetic_ws/
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro noetic -y
    ```

4. Build the workspace:

    ```bash
    cd ~/cpr_noetic_ws/
    catkin_make
    ```

5. Modify your robot-wide setup file (`/etc/ros/setup.bash`) to source your new workspace instead
   of the base noetic install:

    ```bash
    source /home/administrator/cpr_noetic_ws/devel/setup.bash
    ```

6. Reinitialize your environment so that it picks up your new workspace:

    ```bash
    source /etc/ros/setup.bash
    ```

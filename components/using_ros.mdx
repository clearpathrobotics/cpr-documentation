Robot Operating System (ROS) is an extensible framework for controlling and working with robotic systems.
Clearpath Robotics recommends using ROS with your robot. If this is your first time using ROS, it is strongly
recommended to run through our series of [ROS tutorials](../../../ros) to learn
the basics of ROS.

:::note
All Clearpath robots ship from the factory with their login password set to `clearpath`. Upon receipt of your
robot we recommend changing the password.
:::

To change the password to log into your robot, run the following command:

```bash
passwd
```

This will prompt you to enter the current password, followed by the new password twice. While typing the
passwords in the `passwd` prompt there will be no visual feedback (e.g. "\*" characters).

To further restrict access to your robot you can reconfigure the robot's SSH service to disallow logging in with a
password and require SSH certificates to log in.
[This tutorial](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-setup-passwordless-ssh-login/) covers how to configure SSH to
disable password-based login.

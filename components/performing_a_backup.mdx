1.  As a fail-safe, please make an image of your robot's hard drive. You should always be able to restore this image
    if you need to revert back to your previous configuration.

    - The easiest approach may be to either connect a removable (USB or similar) hard drive to the robot computer, or to unplug
      the robot hard drive and insert it into a computer or workstation.
    - You can then use a tool such as CloneZilla or dd to write a backup image of your robot's hard drive onto another
      hard drive.
    - Alternatively, you can simply replace the robot computer's hard-drive, reserving the drive and installing a new one
      to use with Noetic.

2.  There are several places in the filesystem you should specifically look for customizations for your robot:

    | Location                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
    | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `/etc/network/interfaces` or `/etc/netplan/*` | Your robot may have a custom network configuration configured in this file.                                                                                    |
    | `/etc/ros/*/*-core.d/*.launch`                | Will contain `base.launch` and `description.launch`, may contain custom launch files for your robot configuration.  Replaced by `ros.d` in newer versions.     |
    | `/etc/ros/*/ros.d/*.launch`                   | Will contain `base.launch` and `description.launch`, may contain custom launch files for your robot configuration.  Replaces `*-core.d` in newer versions.     |
    | `/etc/ros/setup.bash`                         | May contain environment variables for your configuration.                                                                                                      |

3. Please save all the files listed above and use them as a reference during Noetic configuration.

#### 1. Tools required:

- Dish soap, as a lubricant between the tire and inner tube.
- Torque wrench with a 6 mm hex bit.
- Paint pen or similar fastener marking pen.
- Drill or ratchet with 6 mm hex bit.
- A Clearpath wheel installation tool, or two [M8×1.25 X 35 fully threaded socket head screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/91292A151/).
- Tire inflation pump or compressor, with a pressure gauge (not shown in the image).

#### 2. Note the direction of travel.

You will need to face the tread chevrons pointing torwards the forward travel of the robot.
This will impack which side the tire air-fill stem is installed on.

- Right side wheel, with stem on the right side
- Left side wheel, with stem on the left side.

This is not critical, but improves access to filling the tire with air when it is installed on the robot.

#### 3. Place inner tube on tire, with a half-doughnut shape.

Place this on side of the tire where you want the air-fill stem to be.
The picture show is for a wheel on the left side of the Husky.

#### 4. Push the inner tube into the tire.

Try to keep the half-doughnut shape.

#### 5. Spread dish soap on the outside curved section of both halves of the slipt-rim.

#### 6. Spread dish soap on the edge of the tire, where it will touch the rim.

Do this for both sides of the tire.

#### 7. Slide the air-fill stem through the rim.

Then push the rim onto the tire's face.

#### 8. Flip the wheel over.

Adjust the inner tube so it is sitting around the perimeter of the rim.
You want to make sure the inner tube does not get pinched between the two rims in the following steps.

#### 9. Connect the two halves of the split rim using the intallation tool or two bolts.

Note that the threaded adaper plate does on the side of the rim with the air-fill-stem.
This adapter plate will be visible on the outside of the robot.

#### 10. Clamp the two halves together using M8×1.25 X 12 screws.

You will need to remove the installation tool to access two of the four screw locations.

#### 11. Torque all four screws to 13 N·m.

#### 12. Mark the 4 screws and rim.

This will let you know if screws have loosened in service.

#### 13. Inflate the inner tube to 138 kPa (20 psi).

Bounce the tire on the floor a few times after you have inflated it, and removed the compressor.
The bounching will help seat the tire's bead.

:::note

You can drop the pressure after the tire's bead has seated.
YOu can drop the pressure to as low as 69 kPa (10 psi)

#### 14. Check the tire for any odd stretching, wrinkles, or warped areas.

These anomalies can cause the Husky to not drive straight, and affect your autonomy program's performance.

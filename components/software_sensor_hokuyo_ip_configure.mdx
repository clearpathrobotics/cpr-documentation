You can update the IP address of Hokuyo sensors using the Windows 10 application included in [this ZIP](/assets/zip/hokuyo_ip_changing_tool.zip).
The ZIP file includes the _.exe_ application, and instructions of how to use the application.
Clearpath Robotics products update the IP address of sensors to avoid conflicts, such as two Hokuyo lidar both configured to the _192.168.0.10_ address.

This is an example of the configured front Hokuyo on a robot:

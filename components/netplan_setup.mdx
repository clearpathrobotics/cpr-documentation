Clearpath robots running Ubuntu 20.04 and later use `netplan` for configuration of their wired and wireless interfaces.
To connect your robot to your wireless network using `netplan`, create the file `/etc/netplan/60-wireless.yaml` and fill in the following:

```
network:
  wifis:
    # Replace WIRELESS_INTERFACE with the name of the wireless network device, e.g. wlan0 or wlp3s0
    # Fill in the SSID and PASSWORD fields as appropriate.  The password may be included as plain-text
    # or as a password hash.  To generate the hashed password, run
    #   echo -n 'WIFI_PASSWORD' | iconv -t UTF-16LE | openssl md4 -binary | xxd -p
    # If you have multiple wireless cards you may include a block for each device.
    # For more options, see https://netplan.io/reference/
    WIRELESS_INTERFACE:
      optional: true
      access-points:
        SSID_GOES_HERE:
          password: PASSWORD_GOES_HERE
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp4-overrides:
        send-hostname: true
```

Modify the following variables in the file:

1.  Replace `WIRELESS_INTERFACE` with the name of the robot's Wi-Fi interface (e.g. wlan0, wlp2s0, or wlp3s0).
2.  Replace `SSID_GOES_HERE` with the name of the local Wi-Fi network.
3.  Replace `PASSWORD_GOES_HERE` with the password of the local Wi-Fi network.

Once you are done modifying the file, save it by pressing `CTRL + O`, then `ENTER`.
Close the file by pressing `CTRL + X`.

Then, run the following to bring up the Wi-Fi connection:

```
sudo netplan apply
```

You can validate that the connection was successful and determine the IP address of the Wi-Fi interface by running:

```
ip a
```

A list of network connections will be displayed within the terminal. 
Locate the wireless network and make note of its IP address.

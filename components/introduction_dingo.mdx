## Introduction

Dingo is a lightweight and easy-to-use unmanned indoor ground vehicle for ROS.

There are two Dingo variants:

- **Dingo-D** uses differential drive and has two module bays, one of which must be a battery module; the second
  module is typically a computer module.
- **Dingo-O** uses omnidirectional drive and has four module bays, at two of which are typically battery modules;
  the other modules may be computer modules or serve as expansion for other custom hardware.

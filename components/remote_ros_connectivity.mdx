To use ROS desktop tools, you will need the Remote Computer to be able to connect to your robot's ROS master. This will allow
you to run ROS commands like `rostopic list`, `rostopic echo`, `rosnode list`, and others, from the Remote Computer and the
output will reflect the activity on your robot's ROS master, rather than on the Remote Computer. This can be a tricky
process, but we have tried to make it as simple as possible.

In order for the ROS tools on the Remote Computer to talk to your robot, they need to know two things:

- How to find the ROS master, which is set in the `ROS_MASTER_URI` environment variable, and
- How processes on the ROS master can find the Remote Computer, which is the `ROS_IP` environment variable.

The suggested pattern is to create a file in your home directory called `remote-robot.sh` with the following contents:

```
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://cpr-robot-0001:11311 # Your robot's hostname
export ROS_IP=10.25.0.102 # Your Remote Computer's wireless IP address
```

If your network does not already resolve your robot's hostname to its wireless IP address, you may need to add a
corresponding line to the Remote Computer's `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.25.0.101 cpr-robot-0001
```

:::note

You can verify the hostname and IP address of your robot using the following commands during an SSH session
with the Onboard Computer.

:::

```
hostname
hostname -i
```

Then, when you are ready to communicate remotely with your robot, you can source that script like so, thus defining
those two key environment variables in the present context.

```
source remote-robot.sh
```

To verify that everything is set up properly, try running a few ROS commands:

```
rosrun rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor
rosrun rqt_console rqt_console
```

You can also run the RViz commands outlined in the Tutorials.

If the tools launch, then everything is setup properly. If you still need assistance
in configuring remote access, please contact Clearpath Support. For more general details on how ROS works over TCP with

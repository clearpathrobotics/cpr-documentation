1. If you have a mini-ITX computer installed it will need to be removed. With the computer tray
   open locate each of the cables connected to the motherboard and hard drive. Remove the power,
   power switch, USB and SATA cables. The two cable ties can be cut to completely remove the power
   and SATA cables. The two antenna cables are connected underneath. Keep this in mind for the
   next steps.

2. Remove the four (4) hex screws from the motherboard using a 2.5mm wrench. Gently lift it out
   disconnecting the antenna connectors as you do so.

3. Remove the zipties holding the USB header, power switch signal and antenna wire. The Jetson
   Nano doesn't have a USB header so it will have to be replaced with a USB mini cable. You will
   need extra slack in both the antenna cable and power switch signal as well.

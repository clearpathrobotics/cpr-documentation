If your PS4 controller runs out of batteries, or you purchase a new one, you might want to re-pair your platform
and controller. To do this, put the controller into pairing mode by pressing and holding the Share and PS buttons
until the controller's LED flashes rapidly in white. Then SSH into the robot and run:

```bash
sudo ds4drv-pair
```

If `ds4drv-pair` fails to detect the controller, you can connect it manually by running `sudo bluetoothctl`
and entering the following commands into the bluetooth control application:

```bash
agent on
scan on
```

The bluetooth scan will display the MAC addresses of nearby devices. Determine with MAC address corresponds to the
controller and copy it. Then run the following commands in bluetoothctl:

```bash
scan off
pair <MAC Address>
trust <MAC Address>
connect <MAC Address>
```

The controller should now be correctly paired.

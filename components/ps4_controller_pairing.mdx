If your PS4 controller runs out of batteries, or you purchase a new one, you might want to re-pair your platform and controller. 

To do this:

1. Make sure the `ds4drv` driver is installed, and the `ds4drv` daemon service is active and running:

```
sudo systemctl status ds4drv
```

2. If `ds4drv` is not installed, install it by running:

```
sudo apt-get install python-ds4drv
```

3. Put the controller into pairing mode by pressing and holding the SHARE and PS buttons until the controller's LED light bar flashes rapidly in white. 

4. SSH into the robot. The remaining instructions below assume you are already SSH'd into the robot.

5. Run the controller pairing script:

```
sudo ds4drv-pair
```

5. In the output of the `ds4drv-pair` script, you should see that the controller automatically pairs via the script. The controller's LED light bar should also turn solid blue to indicate successful pairing.


6. If the `ds4drv-pair` script fails to detect the controller, you can connect it manually by running:

```
sudo bluetoothctl
```

7. Enter the following commands in `bluetoothctl` to scan and display the MAC addresses of nearby devices:

```
agent on
scan on
```

8. Determine which MAC address corresponds to the controller and copy it. Then run the following commands in `bluetoothctl` to pair the controller:

```
scan off
pair <MAC Address>
trust <MAC Address>
connect <MAC Address>
```

9. The controller should now be correctly paired.

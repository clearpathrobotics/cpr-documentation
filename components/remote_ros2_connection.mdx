It is useful to connect your laptop to the same ROS2 network as your robot,
particularly if you want to interface with it through ROS2
topics, services, and actions:

1.  Ensure that your laptop has ROS2 Foxy installed.
2.  Connect your robot's computer and your laptop to the same (wired or
    wireless) network.
3.  Verify that your robot's computer can `ping` your laptop. In a terminal
    on your robot's computer, run:

    ```bash
    ping <YOUR_LAPTOP_IP>
    ```

4.  Verify that your laptop can `ping` your robot's computer. In a terminal
    on your laptop, run:

    ```bash
    ping <ROBOT_COMPUTER_IP>
    ```

5.  You should be able to now be able to access your robot's ROS2 data from
    your laptop, such as viewing ROS2 topics. In a terminal on
    your laptop, run:

    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    ros2 topic list
    ```

6.  If you are unable to access your robot's ROS2 data from your laptop,
    make sure to set the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` environment variable on your
    laptop to the same value as on your robot's computer. By default,
    `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` is set to 0 (in ROS2 and on your robot), so you will not
    need to do this step. However, if `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` is set to a
    different value on your robot, make sure to do the same on your laptop.
    In a terminal on your laptop, run:

    ```bash
    export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<ROBOT_ROS_DOMAIN_ID>
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    ```

You should now be able to access your robot's ROS2 data (e.g. topics,
services, and actions) from your laptop.

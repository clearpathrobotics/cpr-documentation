Our Support team may ask you to create a _rosbag_.
This is a tool that saves ROS data to a file, so we can review it after the robot has been turned off.

For example, we may ask you to record the _/status_ topic so we can review motor temperatures, and other diagnostic data.
To create this rosbag, you would:

1.  Log into the robot's computer.
2.  Run the command `rosbag record /status`
3.  Use your robot as you typically would, trying to recreate the issue you have been experiencing.
4.  Once done, in the terminal, press `ctrl+c` to stop the command.
5.  Enter `ls`, and find the new file that was created. It will have a file extension of _.bag_
6.  Copy this file to your development computer, using a command like [`scp`](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/TransferFiles).
    Send this _.bag_ file to Clearpath Robotics in your Support email request.

Set your laptop's ethernet port to a static IP such as 192.168.131.101. To do this in Ubuntu, follow the steps below:

1.  Click on the Wifi icon in the upper-right corner of your screen, and select Edit Connections.
2.  In the Network Connections window, under Ethernet, select your wired connection and then click Edit.
3.  Select the IPv4 Settings tab and then change the Method to Manual.
4.  Click the Add button to add a new address.
5.  Enter a 192.168.131.101 as the static IP under the Address column, and enter 255.255.255.0 under the Netmask
    column, and then select Save.

The next step is to connect to your robot via SSH. To do so execute the following in a terminal window:

`ssh administrator@192.168.131.1`

You will be promoted to enter a password. The default password is `clearpath` and you set a new password
on first connection.
